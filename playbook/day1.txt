1
00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:32.640
Jason Liu: All right. Thank you, Marin, for organizing some notes, those saving my life.

2
00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.910
Jason Liu: I'm just like instant admit all a thousand times in a row.

3
00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:14.460
âš¡ Marian Noble (she/her): Make me a co-host. I'll do it.

4
00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:15.540
Jason Liu: Bye.

5
00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.900
âš¡ Marian Noble (she/her): Thank you.

6
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:20.140
Jason Liu: Sweet.

7
00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:31.070
Jason Liu: This is automatically recording. So let's just yeah. Let's wait. One more minute, and then I'll we'll jump in

8
00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.599
Jason Liu: and then can everyone see the raise hand, button.

9
00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.990
âš¡ Marian Noble (she/her): Yes.

10
00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:38.740
Jason Liu: Perfect cool.

11
00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.800
Jason Liu: so I will be answering some of the questions that Marion sent me first, st and then we can jump into just like a

12
00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:51.269
Jason Liu: regular conversation is a there are plenty of questions to go over

13
00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.070
Jason Liu: alright together.

14
00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.110
Jason Liu: Yeah, I'll definitely answer the question about cold outreach in a little bit.

15
00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.250
Jason Liu: Alright. Let's jump in. I'm super excited to actually

16
00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.819
Jason Liu: have a conversation with everybody. I think most of the conversations I've had had to be on like

17
00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.730
Jason Liu: Twitter Dms and emails. So it's nice to see everyone's faces for the 1st time.

18
00:02:39.297 --> 00:02:46.840
Jason Liu: Cool. Let's I'm gonna just jump in straight to Marion's questions that we shared, and then we will do

19
00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.540
Jason Liu: anything notable from slack, and then we'll go into hand raising.

20
00:02:52.960 --> 00:03:02.960
Jason Liu: So this 1st question is very important to me, which is, is there a reason to not use medium or its AI publishers to publish layer and get more exposure?

21
00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.719
Jason Liu: The fundamental issue is, if you start posting on medium or posting on. You know. Tds.

22
00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.069
Jason Liu: when an engineer shares the article.

23
00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.220
Jason Liu: it is often in the position of

24
00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:18.460
Jason Liu: oh, I saw something on medium. There's a bunch of stuff on medium.

25
00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:24.229
Jason Liu: And your brand, as the author is kind of diminished by the the intensity of like Tds.

26
00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.589
Jason Liu: And it's really hard to have 2 things.

27
00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.720
Jason Liu: It's really hard to have a C. It's really hard to have a Cta that says like, Call me.

28
00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:33.780
Jason Liu: And it's really hard to change that

29
00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:36.790
Jason Liu: to a Cta of like pay me to call me

30
00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:40.490
Jason Liu: so that that transition is going to be a bit of a challenge.

31
00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:43.830
Jason Liu: The second thing is.

32
00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.960
Jason Liu: if you have your own website, then what you can do is you can. You can publish a blog

33
00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:52.719
Jason Liu: as well as having email capture as well as having a services page.

34
00:03:53.460 --> 00:04:01.469
Jason Liu: And there's there's been many times when people will read my blog post. They'll kind of like, see the blog, maybe over the course of 5 months, 6 months.

35
00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:07.339
Jason Liu: and then they're finally ready to click services and see what that's about, and see what makes sense for them.

36
00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:11.240
Jason Liu: And so there's a lot of value in capturing the wrong audience.

37
00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:13.020
Jason Liu: The second thing is.

38
00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:20.060
Jason Liu: even though there are more readers for something like that. The tam is a very like low intent, Tam.

39
00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:22.849
Jason Liu: The content is like how to use Langchain.

40
00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:30.160
Jason Liu: but really the content that matters for the people who are actually going to be paying for consulting is going to be. How do I run my team more effectively?

41
00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:37.079
Jason Liu: And the question is, is that content on Tds, or is that a content that should just be written on your own blog.

42
00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:40.919
Jason Liu: Try to get that on Hacker news around Twitter, and then, you know, go from there.

43
00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:55.819
Jason Liu: I'm just an aside for the best tools to publish. I use just markdown Docs, Mkdocs material. It's a very simple framework. It's all in Markdown. I use cursor to edit some code. I'll make sure to have an example of that

44
00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:59.639
Jason Liu: when I, when I share some of the resources from today.

45
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.679
Jason Liu: can you touch on how you find your audience in the 1st place? Yeah.

46
00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:13.590
Jason Liu: I would 1st say, like, I would 1st ask the question of like, what is the dream of that audience. And what is the message I have?

47
00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:19.480
Jason Liu: Because once I know what the dream is and what the message is, I can figure out if the audience makes sense

48
00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:24.189
Jason Liu: like. When I did write instructor, it really was this case where man, I really think that

49
00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.670
Jason Liu: all these like Vc. By frameworks.

50
00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:28.900
Jason Liu: I don't know how much I can trust them.

51
00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:34.479
Jason Liu: And oftentimes they're gonna they're gonna keep growing. And I don't know if I want something to keep growing. I want a simple tool.

52
00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:43.160
Jason Liu: And so if you, if you approach your marketing that way, the marketing, just this is a simple tool that does one thing well, and this is something that could work for you.

53
00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:47.150
Jason Liu: Then the audience will come secondary, right

54
00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:54.240
Jason Liu: with the rad course. It was. Well, I'm getting to a point where I'm really tired of saying the same thing over and over again.

55
00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:55.590
Jason Liu: But

56
00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:01.360
Jason Liu: I can't really get that many of an interesting testimonial, because it takes a long time to improve your rag applications.

57
00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:09.880
Jason Liu: But if I build this course, then, as my consulting prices go up, I can fill in some space in the bottom and distribute that way

58
00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:14.350
Jason Liu: right? But a lot of it is, what is your message, and what is the dream first? st

59
00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:18.999
Jason Liu: And then how do you get to the audience. Afterwards

60
00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:26.710
Jason Liu: a meeting hit the Max capacity. I thought I paid extra for for zoom.

61
00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:28.880
Jason Liu: Oh, my gosh,

62
00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:35.100
Jason Liu: How do you explore and identify the keywords around the tam.

63
00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:40.790
Jason Liu: The general idea here is that once you.

64
00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:46.049
Jason Liu: it's it's almost harder to figure out the tam before you write something.

65
00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:54.160
Jason Liu: But what ends up happening is as you write it. You kind of you have a feel for what's going on. I'll give the common example that, like Mr. Beast gives, which is.

66
00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:55.949
Jason Liu: you know, if if your title was

67
00:06:56.020 --> 00:07:01.930
Jason Liu: today, I went to New York and had a great chicken sandwich, a great chicken sandwich

68
00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:10.670
Jason Liu: today, I want is basically has, like just Tam, of who the people who know me once you add the word New York. It's like, Okay, the people who know me, but also care about New York.

69
00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:22.659
Jason Liu: And at some point you're starting at to add words like fried chicken and whatnot. But then what you had to earn was, you had to earn them reading the 1st 7 words of your blog post, which already is very hard. Right?

70
00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:26.280
Jason Liu: But if I say, if you want to have the best chick fed chicken in New York.

71
00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:28.949
Jason Liu: This is the restaurant you should go to.

72
00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:41.460
Jason Liu: and then you can start talking about. Well, last week, my best friend and I met up in New York for the 1st time in 10 years, and we thought about where to go, and and it seemed to be the best place based on the review that we saw. And we went. We tried 3 different places.

73
00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:43.259
Jason Liu: If you want to learn more about like.

74
00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:49.519
Jason Liu: you know, other places we checked out. Here's a newsletter, if you want to, like, you know, go to the restaurant. Here's the resi link.

75
00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:53.879
Jason Liu: Now you can create desire and action once you can provide information.

76
00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:56.419
Jason Liu: But the reward is like fully in the title.

77
00:07:56.630 --> 00:08:00.030
Jason Liu: right? That's how I think about something like this.

78
00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:08.126
Jason Liu: are you able to share, which blog posts are the ones that got the most views? The one that led to the most conversion is

79
00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:10.589
Jason Liu: rag is more than embeddings.

80
00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:17.959
Jason Liu: And I wrote it basically in the beginning of last year, where everyone was thinking about embedding. So the tam for Embeddings was massive.

81
00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:20.060
Jason Liu: The tam for rag was massive.

82
00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:25.209
Jason Liu: And not only that, the emotional reaction was basically

83
00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:31.130
Jason Liu: every person trying to figure it out had the feeling of like I knew that was the case.

84
00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:33.499
Jason Liu: like, I need to read this thing.

85
00:08:33.659 --> 00:08:36.799
Jason Liu: And then every like researcher in Ir was like.

86
00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:43.249
Jason Liu: I can't believe these like new software engineers like don't understand like anything about information retrieval.

87
00:08:43.539 --> 00:08:48.129
Jason Liu: right? And that immediately got like 30,000 views on Hacker news. And that kind of was like

88
00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:58.929
Jason Liu: the one of the first, st like 2 or 3 big breaks that we had in in this session. Marion, do you know, how can we like incrementally upgrade zoom? I thought I had paid.

89
00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:05.499
âš¡ Marian Noble (she/her): Yeah, absolutely. I don't know, do you? Is it Karina or Maria, that I should talk to about that? Because I don't have your zoom.

90
00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:07.931
Jason Liu: Oh, shoot! Okay, let let me

91
00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:10.229
Jason Liu: let me figure this out. How many.

92
00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:16.930
âš¡ Marian Noble (she/her): But it is, it is recording, and it will be uploaded to Maven, and we will fix this on Wednesday.

93
00:09:17.510 --> 00:09:18.620
Jason Liu: Okay. Okay.

94
00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:18.970
âš¡ Marian Noble (she/her): Yeah.

95
00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:20.820
Jason Liu: Toma, also.

96
00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:24.280
âš¡ Marian Noble (she/her): Probably get the Slido so we can

97
00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:27.450
âš¡ Marian Noble (she/her): navigate all these hundreds of questions y'all are sending in.

98
00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:28.265
Jason Liu: Yeah,

99
00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:42.280
Jason Liu: while we share. Alpha. Okay, while sharing Alpha is recommended. Should we also share the Github links and code? I don't think so, because again, most people don't want to be taught how to fish.

100
00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:45.640
Jason Liu: I think most people just want the fish.

101
00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:58.169
Jason Liu: and unless that code is something that can be used. You could use it as proof right? Like, if you build a lightweight like eval framework. And then someone can come to you and say, oh, that's basically what I want.

102
00:09:58.250 --> 00:10:00.819
Jason Liu: Can you just come on board and help us figure this out?

103
00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:02.989
Jason Liu: There's definitely value in that.

104
00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:08.169
Jason Liu: But I would almost ask, like how many people would actually read the blog post and even run the code.

105
00:10:08.950 --> 00:10:10.660
Jason Liu: because I would say that

106
00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:17.099
Jason Liu: the person who has enough time to then run. The code is probably not the person who

107
00:10:17.290 --> 00:10:19.809
Jason Liu: is trying to spend money to buy their time back

108
00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:28.750
Jason Liu: right? And so, like the tam of someone who would run. The code is already someone who's inherently like less valuable from a customer perspective.

109
00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:34.220
Jason Liu: Right? That's how I think about it's like, does the person with money, actually

110
00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:37.879
Jason Liu: do this thing. And like, can we? Can we can we fish?

111
00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:42.609
Jason Liu: Yeah, most people want to play fish, you know, the the busier I get the more it's like, Okay, well, I don't even

112
00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:48.370
Jason Liu: like I have to, you know, only spend money to get my time back. And that's kind of

113
00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:50.709
Jason Liu: the ideal customer right?

114
00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:59.220
Jason Liu: Like the Hacker news person who's like, Oh, I could re I could rebuild Dropbox from scratch is not someone who values their time very much and so inherently a bad customer.

115
00:11:00.671 --> 00:11:05.649
Jason Liu: What is your view on technical? How to versus a general non-technical case? Study content.

116
00:11:06.450 --> 00:11:10.949
Jason Liu: How do you show your expertise without talking about technical details and including coach snippets.

117
00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:18.370
Jason Liu: Well, I think that's that's 1 of the big things we'll talk about to Wednesday, which is

118
00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:23.079
Jason Liu: technical details are kind of the lowest pole of value.

119
00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:31.609
Jason Liu: Right? Technical details is like a bricklayer saying, they're like, Oh, like, I lay bricks like, really fast. And I'm really good at like laying the bricks.

120
00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:35.439
Jason Liu: But as you go up the value hierarchy, the real question is.

121
00:11:35.510 --> 00:11:38.679
Jason Liu: how much is it going to cost you if this building is delayed

122
00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:45.339
Jason Liu: right like, how are you gonna feel when people can't move in to the condo? Right?

123
00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:51.929
Jason Liu: How? How's it gonna feel? If like. We can't get this done before the winter and project is delayed until January.

124
00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:57.150
Jason Liu: How much is that like? How much is that insurance worth to you that

125
00:11:57.870 --> 00:12:02.049
Jason Liu: the implementation might be, yeah, well, I will get it done because I lay the bricks really fast.

126
00:12:03.290 --> 00:12:08.689
Jason Liu: But the question should really be like, What is the cost of not getting this done before the winter

127
00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:13.449
Jason Liu: like, if this prototype is not finished by the summer and the Vcs. Go on their holidays.

128
00:12:15.010 --> 00:12:21.299
Jason Liu: you know you might miss out on like a 2 million dollar raise and like it looks opt. And on the optics is you just delay a raise.

129
00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:29.149
Jason Liu: but then you can ask, like, how many employees do you have? How much burn do you have left? It sounds like you really need to get this thing up and running to show that you can.

130
00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:31.900
Jason Liu: you know, have a demo, so you can find these investors.

131
00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:39.519
Jason Liu: And now, all of a sudden, like your job could be like, can I invite these 2 to dinner? Right? You can really creatively go up and down this

132
00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:45.049
Jason Liu: this time versus value spectrum. And that's something we're going to talk a lot about on on Wednesday.

133
00:12:46.010 --> 00:12:51.010
Jason Liu: Would you modify anything if you talk to less technical people as the audience or not?

134
00:12:51.060 --> 00:13:09.060
Jason Liu: I would say so, because being technical really is just a part of being proof like, if you use jargon, what you're saying is, I look like a certain kind of character, right? And so if you use jargon, what's going to happen is the engineering team might be reading this blog post, sharing it on on slack, and then the Vp of engineering clicks it up

135
00:13:09.570 --> 00:13:10.380
Jason Liu: right?

136
00:13:11.077 --> 00:13:16.249
Jason Liu: Whereas if it's not technical again, we should be focusing on the outputs

137
00:13:16.410 --> 00:13:18.149
Jason Liu: of the the work that you're doing.

138
00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:22.250
Jason Liu: Let me let me jump through a couple more that I think are gonna be really interesting.

139
00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:31.439
Jason Liu: How do you identify and validate your initial target audience. Did you start broad or narrow over time? Or did you focus on specific services from the beginning?

140
00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:36.020
Jason Liu: I think you generally will go for a broader audience. But.

141
00:13:36.490 --> 00:13:46.579
Jason Liu: like my, my plan is pretty pretty crazy. I basically say, if I have a single idea, I want to have multiple ways of positioning it, and I'll just write the same tweet

142
00:13:47.410 --> 00:13:49.690
Jason Liu: like once a day.

143
00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:55.060
Jason Liu: and it's never the case that the tweets get the same amount of views. It's always going to be the case where?

144
00:13:55.290 --> 00:14:00.276
Jason Liu: Because I changed the title somehow, it's going to be 10 times more views, right? Like

145
00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:04.940
Jason Liu: for example, a lot of people I noticed were making hiring mistakes.

146
00:14:05.510 --> 00:14:09.079
Jason Liu: So the 1st piece was, it was, gonna be like like how to hire AI engineers.

147
00:14:09.450 --> 00:14:11.360
Jason Liu: So that's not very useful right?

148
00:14:11.510 --> 00:14:16.570
Jason Liu: But it became like, Okay, if you hire an AI engineer too early, they're just going. They're gonna just join Openai

149
00:14:16.890 --> 00:14:20.970
Jason Liu: or like a pre-seed company to not be hiring machine learning engineers.

150
00:14:21.390 --> 00:14:27.820
Jason Liu: It's the same idea of just like if you hire someone too soon, they're gonna like leave and join something else. But as you just play around with the Tweets.

151
00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:30.499
Jason Liu: you end up finding the Tweet that is

152
00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:33.790
Jason Liu: like a hundred times more engagement.

153
00:14:34.090 --> 00:14:36.470
Jason Liu: and they go great. Oh, that's the that's the thing.

154
00:14:37.190 --> 00:14:42.020
Jason Liu: The number one mistake I see in hiring is hiring an mle too soon.

155
00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:50.949
Jason Liu: Right? If they hire too soon, they're going to hate writing Javascript. They're going to quit and join Openai, and you know they're going to be waiting on you to collect data

156
00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:53.030
Jason Liu: da-da-da-da-da-da-da

157
00:14:53.170 --> 00:15:04.450
Jason Liu: right? And then in the in the middle. You can say, Well, I I know this because I'm a consultant, and you can like have a hot link right? That's a post that goes viral on hacker news. Now you can start building momentum on.

158
00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:05.949
Jason Liu: you know, getting intent.

159
00:15:05.970 --> 00:15:07.430
Jason Liu: And, more importantly.

160
00:15:07.930 --> 00:15:14.130
Jason Liu: the person who is hiring people is definitely a customer that has money that's willing to pay pay money to to save time.

161
00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:15.160
Jason Liu: Right?

162
00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:18.029
Jason Liu: And so there's a lot of different angles that can go there.

163
00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:21.869
Jason Liu: So the hiring example, what I ended up doing was making a job board.

164
00:15:22.190 --> 00:15:27.140
Jason Liu: And it's okay. If you're reading this blog post on hiring, he's a job board for everyone else who's talking about machine learning?

165
00:15:28.611 --> 00:15:37.679
Jason Liu: Cool. I think those are some of the the questions that I would say. I'll answer this one last question before I jump onto the zoom, and then we can just like raise our hands.

166
00:15:39.270 --> 00:15:43.719
Jason Liu: Which is, how do you know when a piece of content or article idea is good enough.

167
00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:47.410
Jason Liu: I would always just write too early. I would always ship too early.

168
00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:53.190
Jason Liu: because the if it's bad content, it just won't be seen by anybody. So you're safe

169
00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:58.309
Jason Liu: like, you're not gonna write a bad plot post that embarrasses you. That also gets like a million views

170
00:15:58.580 --> 00:16:03.159
Jason Liu: and like the tweets that aren't like the jokes that aren't funny are just like not being shown on the newsfeed.

171
00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:08.180
Jason Liu: And I really want you guys to push that because

172
00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:18.259
Jason Liu: the experiment is also not just the quality of the article. But it's like, Am I actually able to command attention? And am I able to say something that people will listen to.

173
00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:21.460
Jason Liu: and that's how I can become the expert right?

174
00:16:21.530 --> 00:16:24.629
Jason Liu: Like I will write the same blog twice and post it twice.

175
00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:28.590
Jason Liu: and then it's like, Oh, really, the people thing that people care about isn't actually

176
00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:33.730
Jason Liu: like. If I'm twice as fast, people don't want to do twice as much work. They want to go home sooner.

177
00:16:33.930 --> 00:16:37.450
Jason Liu: because that blog post, like, you know, did a lot better in terms of engagement.

178
00:16:38.846 --> 00:16:43.899
Jason Liu: And then again, you sort of like you start learning like, what is the thing that draws people together?

179
00:16:44.250 --> 00:16:46.320
Jason Liu: Because again, the the goal is

180
00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:51.439
Jason Liu: once you know what resonates in the blogs. This is what you say during a sales call

181
00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:55.760
Jason Liu: right? And that is like the the hack. It's like, I don't wanna

182
00:16:55.970 --> 00:17:01.800
Jason Liu: practiced sales 50 times. So that's that's like, if I had 50 sales calls, that's actually a ton of work.

183
00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:03.970
Jason Liu: But I'm not gonna be able to practice that.

184
00:17:04.170 --> 00:17:05.720
Jason Liu: But I can practice

185
00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:10.800
Jason Liu: like writing a blog post and getting a tent like a hundred 1,000 views and knowing, oh, this is something people care about

186
00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:15.940
Jason Liu: like. Very quickly I learned that every AI startup that's consumer.

187
00:17:16.359 --> 00:17:18.190
Jason Liu: What happens is they go viral.

188
00:17:18.609 --> 00:17:21.710
Jason Liu: and then they have a ton and of churn

189
00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:27.869
Jason Liu: right? So every every consumer app goes viral has a ton of churn, and the thing they lose is trust.

190
00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:44.080
Jason Liu: And I know that because I wrote a blog post on like, you know, the number one issue with consumer products is like, you know, turn and trust. Here's 3 things you can do to like. Improve citations, have better evaluations and communicate expectations to the customer in order to not to set expectations well.

191
00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:53.139
Jason Liu: right, and they go. Oh, this is something that resonates with a lot of people. I can either double down on this content, do my own research, and figure out how to do citations better.

192
00:17:53.790 --> 00:18:00.890
Jason Liu: But like better citations, is an implementation detail of not losing the trust of a business.

193
00:18:01.410 --> 00:18:07.320
Jason Liu: and if you can communicate with, look, if you work with me, you will stop losing money.

194
00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:09.070
Jason Liu: How much is that worth to you.

195
00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:14.250
Jason Liu: It's not going to be a function of like your hourly rate. It should be a function of the reduced churn.

196
00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:19.250
Jason Liu: And obviously that conversation is gonna be is a difficult conversation to have. But

197
00:18:20.020 --> 00:18:26.180
Jason Liu: you want you want to have at least skip to that part rather than like in during the call. Learn that. Oh, people are having churn, and

198
00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:28.650
Jason Liu: and I wish I could have communicated a little bit sooner.

199
00:18:29.570 --> 00:18:35.970
Jason Liu: And then, lastly, if if you do, a sales call, and you find out that they are facing churn.

200
00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:38.179
Jason Liu: You can now just send them a blog post

201
00:18:39.150 --> 00:18:45.559
Jason Liu: right instead of saying like, Oh, Jason had a good idea. He he did mention something to. Oh, Jason wrote about this 6 months ago.

202
00:18:46.130 --> 00:18:48.570
Jason Liu: sit okay. What is he thinking about now?

203
00:18:48.650 --> 00:18:50.680
Jason Liu: And like cause. I should have read this 6 months ago.

204
00:18:51.090 --> 00:18:56.460
Jason Liu: right? And now you can change a little bit about sort of your positioning, and how you communicate during the sales process

205
00:18:57.330 --> 00:18:58.170
Jason Liu: cool?

206
00:19:00.050 --> 00:19:06.039
Jason Liu: Should I just be going through the comments, or are people going to raise their hands? And then we can go over some more questions. Martin, what do you think.

207
00:19:07.530 --> 00:19:10.809
âš¡ Marian Noble (she/her): Yeah, let's do some hand raise, get some interaction. I want to hear their voices.

208
00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:12.150
Jason Liu: Let's do it. Let's do it.

209
00:19:12.910 --> 00:19:14.140
âš¡ Marian Noble (she/her): Alright, amar!

210
00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:21.389
Jason Liu: Oh, I think you're muted, or I don't hear sound.

211
00:19:21.390 --> 00:19:24.429
âš¡ Marian Noble (she/her): I don't think his mic's plugged in, or something like that.

212
00:19:25.770 --> 00:19:26.410
âš¡ Marian Noble (she/her): I've been there.

213
00:19:26.410 --> 00:19:32.360
âš¡ Marian Noble (she/her): Your hand by going to the react down at the bottom of the zoom, and then you can click, raise hand. If you have a question.

214
00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:36.669
âš¡ Marian Noble (she/her): we'll go to Tahoe. While Amar's figuring out his technical issue.

215
00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:40.850
Taha: Hey, Jason, can you hear me?

216
00:19:40.850 --> 00:19:42.679
Jason Liu: Yeah, I can hear you.

217
00:19:42.730 --> 00:19:46.060
Taha: Yeah, thank you so much. So my question is.

218
00:19:46.693 --> 00:19:49.600
Taha: I work for a consulting company. So I do

219
00:19:49.740 --> 00:20:08.600
Taha: see, like various people coming from different industries. And then, I guess, like the thing with the AI is that you can apply to a whole bunch of different industries. And that's a little bit of a, you know, kind of an Adhd problem of who actually focus on working. If you don't have any kind of like strict preference in terms of like

220
00:20:08.930 --> 00:20:11.489
Taha: previous kind of industry. Experience things like that.

221
00:20:12.910 --> 00:20:34.595
Taha: and then kind of the part. 2 of that question which kind of connects with part one is that? Let's say you're writing a blog post for these industries. And you said something along the lines of Don't share like a lang chain snippet that is, gonna connect to the technical person for the decision maker who's gonna actually have money.

222
00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:35.410
Jason Liu: Yeah.

223
00:20:35.410 --> 00:20:39.480
Taha: And be the decision maker if you don't have the narrow context of.

224
00:20:39.770 --> 00:20:49.420
Taha: you know, like being on a call with that person of what they exactly need in that moment in their business. Are you gonna kind of like, do the guessing game of

225
00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:58.449
Taha: you know me sitting here and saying, okay, I'm gonna go in the hedge fund vertical. And I'm gonna write about back office automation of Xyz.

226
00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:01.549
Taha: Does that kind of make sense.

227
00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:04.270
Jason Liu: Yeah, I mean.

228
00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:09.970
Jason Liu: I don't know if you would have to write like the article about like this is how hedge funds can do it.

229
00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:12.310
Jason Liu: But like, I think there's an article of just like

230
00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:20.230
Jason Liu: our back office. Automation is similar across different domains, right? Like, if I think about the rag content that I wrote. It really is.

231
00:21:21.250 --> 00:21:27.840
Jason Liu: The real thing is sort of. We need to have some kind of behavioral change as software engineers transition to AI engineering

232
00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:31.820
Jason Liu: right? It's it's a little bit more abstract just to capture more. Tim.

233
00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:38.679
Jason Liu: like I could write an article of like how to do real estate document processing right? But that book

234
00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:42.860
Jason Liu: that is probably not where I would excel at today.

235
00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:44.200
Jason Liu: Right?

236
00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:52.320
Jason Liu: so yeah, I think it could be an angle of like if you really want to go after the hedge fund, it might make sense to buy that kind of content.

237
00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:58.180
Jason Liu: But I think what would make more sense is saying, Okay, you know what? Like, I'm doing a lot of like automation work for many industries.

238
00:21:58.210 --> 00:22:06.889
Jason Liu: Here's a case study in in this industry, in that industry. Here's maybe a portfolio blogs, and how they're similar in many ways and different in many ways.

239
00:22:07.850 --> 00:22:08.670
Jason Liu: right?

240
00:22:09.370 --> 00:22:11.530
Jason Liu: And what I do in sales would be okay

241
00:22:11.810 --> 00:22:20.090
Jason Liu: if if it sounds like one of these industries, I would might say, Okay, here's 2 blog posts that I wrote about this kind of content, like, if this resonates to you. Let's like, bring this up on the next call.

242
00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:23.520
Jason Liu: Right? We can go a little bit deeper like, how can I prepare more and like, what?

243
00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:27.149
Jason Liu: What is the basis that we can work with.

244
00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:29.319
Jason Liu: and have some kind of like share language around that.

245
00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:52.519
Taha: Mostly understood to kind of like make a little bit more concrete. So let's say something like Nl, 2. Sequel. So nl. 2 SQL. You can apply in like many, many different ways. So would it be like the right layer of abstraction to say something like, Hey, like, here's how hedge funds use. Nl, 2, sequel. Here's how like businesses even use analytics or something like that.

246
00:22:52.860 --> 00:22:57.990
Jason Liu: Yeah, exactly. And like, maybe figure out like, are there commonalities across many of these industries? You know.

247
00:22:59.310 --> 00:23:00.839
Taha: Got it all right.

248
00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:02.260
Jason Liu: Wolf.

249
00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:05.190
Jason Liu: Hi, mark! Is is the mic working now.

250
00:23:05.190 --> 00:23:06.240
Ammar Mohanna: Can you hear me now?

251
00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:08.079
Jason Liu: Yes, yes, success.

252
00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:11.640
Ammar Mohanna: Perfect. Hi, everyone! You've been there right, Jason.

253
00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:12.640
Jason Liu: Yep. Yep.

254
00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:39.670
Ammar Mohanna: Yeah. So basically, I, I have a question less related to marketing, more related to specialization on like a longer term. So today's word. We are AI, like consultants. Everyone wants to have our services. That's perfect. But like in in like, in 5 years, and like 2 years would we be still asking for a generic AI consultant, or would we be looking for an AI consultant that is specialized in education

255
00:23:39.690 --> 00:23:49.029
Ammar Mohanna: or an AI consultant that is specialized into a certain industry. Would it be beneficial at the moment to start going that way? So to go like you specialized in a tech

256
00:23:49.070 --> 00:23:59.479
Ammar Mohanna: side like rags. You especially you. You went there like. But there's another another dimension that we can go through going into a certain industry, medicine or education or whatnot.

257
00:23:59.660 --> 00:24:03.720
Ammar Mohanna: and I just want to emphasize on like one question that was asked in the chat.

258
00:24:03.740 --> 00:24:09.369
Ammar Mohanna: how about AI consulting in markets outside of Silicon Valley? That would be really interesting to talk about.

259
00:24:10.110 --> 00:24:12.410
Jason Liu: Yeah. So I've worked with some

260
00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:24.439
Jason Liu: hedge funds in the past, not hedge funds, private equity firms, but they're just like very slow moving a lot of the work I've noticed has been just like in the integration of the software engineering stack, less on the AI stack.

261
00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:26.680
Jason Liu: So a lot of the work there ends up being like

262
00:24:26.730 --> 00:24:32.110
Jason Liu: either it's full advisory or they want some kind of white glove service that does all the implementation.

263
00:24:32.170 --> 00:24:38.109
Jason Liu: So I think the agency route is going to be very successful for a long time. As for specialization.

264
00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:40.080
Jason Liu: I would just

265
00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:46.789
Jason Liu: personally, I would just treat that as like, okay, what industry am I good at and like? What industry do, I think will grow very well?

266
00:24:47.332 --> 00:24:54.290
Jason Liu: So, because I have not done that kind of specialization in in the industry, and I've only done it on the technology side.

267
00:24:54.310 --> 00:24:59.160
Jason Liu: I'm pretty hesitant to sort of make a statement there. But

268
00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:05.759
Jason Liu: I don't think there's anything wrong with specialization. It's only easier to figure out what the Icp is

269
00:25:06.100 --> 00:25:18.729
Jason Liu: right. It's only easier to figure out what those pain points are. So you can write the content that resonates. It's only going to be easier to figure out. How can I have case studies and and figure out like, how would you do? Outbound? Because you know exactly what you're looking for?

270
00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:20.210
Jason Liu: Right for me? It's

271
00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:32.180
Jason Liu: right before and right after series A, or it's a larger company who has a lot of competitors that are startups. Those are like just 2 customers that I've I've really, I have been very, very valuable.

272
00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:36.299
Jason Liu: but that specialization will just only make content and sells easier. I imagine.

273
00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:40.620
Ammar Mohanna: Sounds good. Thanks a lot.

274
00:25:40.810 --> 00:25:41.370
Jason Liu: Okay.

275
00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:42.320
Jason Liu: Sid.

276
00:25:44.300 --> 00:26:10.309
Sid: Hey, Jason? Question is going to come across a little bit rude, but it's not rude. It's just honest. Which is you've identified 2 customer as as you said, like Vc back startups. And then, like maybe bigger enterprise companies. And they all have a bigger budgets to to solve these things. In that space you also establish a lot of credibility because you come from a school you've worked at Meta stitch, fix, and all that kind of stuff.

277
00:26:10.310 --> 00:26:25.450
Sid: Now I live in Florida. I did not go to amazing school. I don't have a degree. I've been in this space for about 4 or 5 years haven't worked at Meta Stitch fix so big big companies like that. How do I? How would I go about starting? By the way, I'm I'm just starting out. So I'm just like.

278
00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:37.110
Sid: Process like. Is it necessary for me like, should I feel handicapped by that, or like, how how would you advise people who are just starting out and basically don't have a big brand.

279
00:26:37.340 --> 00:26:41.550
Jason Liu: Okay. So all those big name brands end up just being proof.

280
00:26:41.630 --> 00:26:50.280
Jason Liu: Right? So we're really saying is like, Okay, like, the proof of the blog post is helpful, but the proof of having gone to like a like Waterloo is like also helpful

281
00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:55.659
Jason Liu: right? So I would mostly focus on like, what is the portfolio of proof that you can build up?

282
00:26:55.960 --> 00:27:01.239
Jason Liu: For example? When I started most of the consulting, it was just

283
00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:06.329
Jason Liu: I had built an application like, I built like an AI journaling app and a transcription app.

284
00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:11.440
Jason Liu: And my 1st client was like new computer where they were building a personal agent.

285
00:27:12.430 --> 00:27:17.270
Jason Liu: And so that contract happened primarily because I had just built something that they were building.

286
00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:23.450
Jason Liu: And they're like, okay, maybe we can hire him because he clearly already solved, like 30% of the problems, right?

287
00:27:23.770 --> 00:27:27.280
Jason Liu: And then the second, like big company I worked with was limitless.

288
00:27:27.410 --> 00:27:32.269
Jason Liu: And again, it's because I was generating like meeting notes for myself and and doing that. So

289
00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:36.800
Jason Liu: I think the 1st thing is like, yeah, like, what is the proof? And what is the testimonial that we can drive

290
00:27:37.110 --> 00:27:44.589
Jason Liu: right. If there's an industry or a set of tools you think you could build well, just like working on building that and like sharing the lessons

291
00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:46.510
Jason Liu: right? Cause, I think.

292
00:27:47.180 --> 00:27:53.530
Jason Liu: like with with new computer. What happened was, Oh, I built this journaling app. But here are the 3 big problems I ran into.

293
00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:58.810
Jason Liu: And then and like, Did you run into those problems like, Oh, yeah, we're we just started thinking about them.

294
00:27:59.190 --> 00:28:01.920
Jason Liu: It's like great. I can just come on board, and just tell you the answer right now.

295
00:28:02.900 --> 00:28:03.450
Sid: Right.

296
00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:07.290
Jason Liu: Right, and and you can try the app, and that be. That became the proof.

297
00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:08.510
Sid: Gotcha.

298
00:28:09.130 --> 00:28:10.720
Jason Liu: So, yeah, it's just a matter of like.

299
00:28:10.930 --> 00:28:15.479
Jason Liu: in what ways can I prove that? I understand? Like those pain points?

300
00:28:17.370 --> 00:28:27.239
Jason Liu: yeah, I mean? What's I just asked a question, too like, what do you think would be a piece of proof that you think you would want to develop in the near future. Is it going to be like blog posts and be building something.

301
00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:50.959
Sid: Well, I'm actually building. So it's funny. I've been building a Bootstrap product, and I have like about 3,000, Mrr, right now. So not huge, at least not 0 and it's a text to video Api for man and videos. If you've seen this, so you can ask, the math concept will generate a video for you, and and I am. I don't know. I accidentally found a person in my professional network who's like, Hey, would you be

302
00:28:50.960 --> 00:29:04.430
Sid: open to being on a detainer as our like lead. AI whatever. And he's he's paying me like $10,000 a month just to like, be the guy on a call once in a while. I'm like this is great, you know. I've been.

303
00:29:04.430 --> 00:29:05.230
Jason Liu: Yeah, yeah.

304
00:29:05.230 --> 00:29:11.790
Sid: Building this product, and it's like it's like, Pkmr over 6 months of hard work. And I'm making easy money this way. So I'm like.

305
00:29:11.790 --> 00:29:14.900
Jason Liu: The 6 months of hard work got to the 10 Kmr. You know, like, I mean, that's.

306
00:29:15.266 --> 00:29:26.993
Sid: In some ways. Yeah. So I I'm I'm kind of thinking of. Maybe I should like focus a little bit more on service biz side of things. I don't know.

307
00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:32.100
Jason Liu: So right there, I would just say, like, one thing I would focus on is like, Okay, how can you make sure

308
00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:37.129
Jason Liu: you can get a good testimonial and a good referral out of out of them.

309
00:29:37.540 --> 00:29:37.940
Sid: Like.

310
00:29:37.940 --> 00:29:45.240
Jason Liu: If you just DM me, I can help you like get more scripts on that. And then really reflecting on like, what is the actual thing they're trying to pay you for

311
00:29:45.530 --> 00:29:55.190
Jason Liu: right like in that example. If they were to introduce you at a party a year from now, they're not gonna be like, man. I just pay this guy 10 grand a month to jump on. Zoom, that's not what you want. That's not.

312
00:29:55.536 --> 00:29:59.689
Sid: I'm just being honest, like telling you what it is. But yeah.

313
00:29:59.690 --> 00:30:00.070
Jason Liu: Right.

314
00:30:01.410 --> 00:30:05.729
Jason Liu: know what that is. Then you can start thinking about and writing about it. It's like, Oh, like, you know.

315
00:30:05.890 --> 00:30:08.300
Jason Liu: yeah, he got me to the series. A like, that's yeah.

316
00:30:08.300 --> 00:30:16.779
Sid: Yeah. Small business. 50 years. It's just it's not in the Vc space at all. Built a voice assistant for them. That's the biggest thing.

317
00:30:16.780 --> 00:30:17.200
Jason Liu: Got it.

318
00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:18.650
Sid: Precislitary content.

319
00:30:18.920 --> 00:30:20.170
Jason Liu: Yeah, cool.

320
00:30:20.170 --> 00:30:21.400
Sid: Cool. Thank you.

321
00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:25.330
Jason Liu: Awesome. Thank you. Man, yeah. Nick.

322
00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:28.710
Nik McFly â€” Hybrain.ai: Me!

323
00:30:28.930 --> 00:30:29.640
Jason Liu: Yes.

324
00:30:30.185 --> 00:30:31.550
Nik McFly â€” Hybrain.ai: Hello, definitely.

325
00:30:33.290 --> 00:30:41.789
Nik McFly â€” Hybrain.ai: nice to meet you. So right? The question is right. Now in our agency, we're trying to focus on the AI strategy and.

326
00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:44.809
Nik McFly â€” Hybrain.ai: Transformation for enterprise.

327
00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:54.500
Nik McFly â€” Hybrain.ai: And at the moment we're trying to get a huge leads, you know, with companies like from 500 people.

328
00:30:55.180 --> 00:30:59.069
Nik McFly â€” Hybrain.ai: And yeah, do.

329
00:30:59.460 --> 00:31:00.580
Nik McFly â€” Hybrain.ai: Hmm.

330
00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:07.849
Nik McFly â€” Hybrain.ai: Do you have any advice on working with large enterprise?

331
00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:19.629
Nik McFly â€” Hybrain.ai: And and do you have anything to say about this? The whole concept of AI transformation as a service like.

332
00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:21.600
Jason Liu: Yeah, I would.

333
00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:25.860
Jason Liu: The the biggest company I've worked for is like Hubspot.

334
00:31:25.930 --> 00:31:29.300
Jason Liu: and most of that is like figuring out legal.

335
00:31:29.730 --> 00:31:35.679
Jason Liu: Unfortunately, the sales process, like most of the conversations there for me are just okay.

336
00:31:36.420 --> 00:31:39.100
Jason Liu: How quickly can we identify

337
00:31:39.670 --> 00:31:47.849
Jason Liu: the product requirements and the success criteria? How quickly can we identify who is the qualified purchaser of

338
00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:49.620
Jason Liu: the agency?

339
00:31:49.910 --> 00:31:55.579
Jason Liu: Right? Like, the worst thing you want to do is you want to have like 7 conversations with someone who's like, actually not the person.

340
00:31:55.740 --> 00:31:59.960
Jason Liu: And then you send them a proposal. Great! We'll share this back with the team, and like 6 months goes by.

341
00:32:00.130 --> 00:32:05.020
Jason Liu: So most of that would, I would, I would imagine, is going to be on the sales side of things.

342
00:32:05.410 --> 00:32:08.509
Jason Liu: And then the other hand of that is going to be.

343
00:32:08.910 --> 00:32:12.480
Jason Liu: I would bet, like 40% of those conversations

344
00:32:12.890 --> 00:32:17.820
Jason Liu: on the job for strategy is gonna be like so facilitation and therapy.

345
00:32:18.780 --> 00:32:20.090
Jason Liu: And

346
00:32:20.690 --> 00:32:25.059
Jason Liu: like one of the things I'm doing is I'm trying to take like some more like facilitation courses. So I can

347
00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:29.110
Jason Liu: be better at that. But a lot of it will just be

348
00:32:29.260 --> 00:32:32.339
Jason Liu: sort of the legal and the politics of the big organization.

349
00:32:33.390 --> 00:32:34.110
Jason Liu: Oh.

350
00:32:34.460 --> 00:32:41.429
Jason Liu: yeah, I, in terms of like the actual strategic stuff, I think it's just like if you have the. If you believe you have the knowledge, you have the knowledge, and that's totally fine. But

351
00:32:42.210 --> 00:32:47.349
Jason Liu: I've I've the legal has been the most challenging part for me, cause I'm just like

352
00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:49.390
Jason Liu: one person with a 1 lawyer.

353
00:32:52.210 --> 00:32:52.840
Nik McFly â€” Hybrain.ai: Thank you.

354
00:32:52.840 --> 00:32:55.590
Jason Liu: So Sebastian.

355
00:32:56.370 --> 00:33:06.150
sebastian: Hey? I'm new at this. But just terminology, what's the difference between a consultancy and an agency? Is it just like the number of people you have.

356
00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:11.670
Jason Liu: Oh, man, I don't know if I have a good definition, mostly because

357
00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:14.160
Jason Liu: I know I'm not an agency.

358
00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:19.800
Jason Liu: because the so like in any business. There's like the real problem you're solving.

359
00:33:20.270 --> 00:33:23.340
Jason Liu: And I think if I'm an agency, the real problem solving is

360
00:33:23.370 --> 00:33:25.549
Jason Liu: hiring and managing my own talent.

361
00:33:25.630 --> 00:33:28.880
Jason Liu: So I can like sell their time differently.

362
00:33:31.270 --> 00:33:36.309
Jason Liu: And I think that's that's the only decision. Like, I, I want to solve a marketing problem.

363
00:33:37.180 --> 00:33:42.980
Jason Liu: I don't want to solve a hiring problem, because the reason AI consulting is working is because it's hard to hire.

364
00:33:43.180 --> 00:33:47.599
Jason Liu: So I want to. I don't want to save solve the same problem. Everyone else is trying to solve

365
00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:53.390
Jason Liu: right like the joke is like, I barely want to work for myself, like I gotta really figure out how I can convince other people that work with me.

366
00:33:55.850 --> 00:34:01.309
Jason Liu: yeah, yeah, Mary says, like agencies get most of the work done for them where the consultancies are more advisory.

367
00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:05.470
sebastian: Okay, but yeah.

368
00:34:07.860 --> 00:34:08.670
Jason Liu: Gabriel.

369
00:34:11.570 --> 00:34:13.479
Gabriel Garrett: Hey? Can you hear me, Jason?

370
00:34:13.489 --> 00:34:14.389
Jason Liu: Yep. Yep.

371
00:34:14.670 --> 00:34:34.959
Gabriel Garrett: Cool. Yeah. So my question is, how would you navigate trying to branch out and marketing yourself as a consultant like on on Linkedin with your content when you're still at your job, and it'd be like obvious to your employer what you're trying to do if you're putting calls to action in your your content, or if you put it in your bio that you're a consultant.

372
00:34:36.460 --> 00:34:45.459
Jason Liu: I think there it would just be figuring. So I guess the best question to rephrase is like, if I'm W. 2. How do I like invest now.

373
00:34:48.110 --> 00:34:51.600
Jason Liu: I would probably purely just write for a technical audience.

374
00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:55.860
Jason Liu: and then the Cta should just be to build an audience

375
00:34:56.449 --> 00:35:09.349
Jason Liu: right? It's like if you're if you're doing some like prompting like, okay, here's like 3 things I learned this week. Here's like a mistake that wasted like a month of my time. Here's like, here's some technical content. And then maybe the goal is just like, Get more followers.

376
00:35:09.470 --> 00:35:13.600
Jason Liu: And and then the proof is the fact that you work at this company

377
00:35:14.540 --> 00:35:22.710
Jason Liu: right? So it's like, Oh, like, I'm like the a engineer at this business, you know. I want to write about the stuff I've learned, and the stuff that the mistakes we've had, you know.

378
00:35:23.250 --> 00:35:27.360
Jason Liu: before you transition, the Cta could literally be like, we're also hiring

379
00:35:27.830 --> 00:35:31.530
Jason Liu: right like you could align it to be the same incentive right.

380
00:35:31.740 --> 00:35:32.560
Gabriel Garrett: Hmm.

381
00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:36.109
Jason Liu: And then, if you leave, you can just like change the Ctas.

382
00:35:37.090 --> 00:35:37.470
Gabriel Garrett: True.

383
00:35:37.470 --> 00:35:44.699
Jason Liu: Right, because because your goal is to figure out what resonates with the audience and sort of the Cta doesn't have to book a call today right?

384
00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:49.250
Gabriel Garrett: Yeah, it's like my blog posts for the 1st 7 months was like, Follow Twitter.

385
00:35:50.150 --> 00:35:53.449
Jason Liu: But now the I just like edit all the Ctas to be like go on the newsletter

386
00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:59.120
Jason Liu: right? Because now I have more value that I can deliver over the newsletter than on Twitter, but.

387
00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:06.070
Gabriel Garrett: Cool. And if we have all of our stuff like on substack, do you think that's like a good post for blogs?

388
00:36:06.310 --> 00:36:07.590
Gabriel Garrett: This kind of thing.

389
00:36:08.260 --> 00:36:17.979
Gabriel Garrett: Yeah, I don't think the platform matters. I think it's mostly the brand and the linking like, I don't know if you like, if you go on your bio. You can ever have like a check out my services. Page.

390
00:36:18.350 --> 00:36:24.089
Jason Liu: Type relationship with the content. Right? Like, that's the thing I value the most.

391
00:36:25.590 --> 00:36:32.568
Jason Liu: But you know, you could always just like, say, okay. Every once in a while I'll send a substack message. I conclude the link to book a call. If the content is relevant.

392
00:36:33.187 --> 00:36:37.630
Jason Liu: I just. I'm much newer at the Newsletter game than the blog game, but.

393
00:36:38.380 --> 00:36:44.369
Gabriel Garrett: I think newsletters are better. Yeah, I've I've realized, yeah, cool, cool. Thanks.

394
00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:45.960
Jason Liu: Hey! John!

395
00:36:46.810 --> 00:36:52.679
John Berryman: Hey, Jason? Thanks for everything so far. Question is about how to play the Twitter game

396
00:36:52.930 --> 00:37:06.889
John Berryman: so I can. I can put a blog post together and post on Twitter, and I've got a small following that'll check it out if I get you to retweet it. I I hit a lot much larger audience. But I think there's a lot not said there in.

397
00:37:06.890 --> 00:37:07.400
Jason Liu: Yeah.

398
00:37:07.785 --> 00:37:12.790
John Berryman: About about how you interact with people and actually build that following.

399
00:37:15.420 --> 00:37:18.020
Jason Liu: So you just want, like the general alpha of how I got.

400
00:37:18.820 --> 00:37:19.140
John Berryman: Tell me.

401
00:37:19.140 --> 00:37:19.950
Jason Liu: 10,000.

402
00:37:20.220 --> 00:37:32.200
Jason Liu: Okay, it's really bad. I have a blog post on anatomy of a good tweet. My money is on most people here. The the follower to Tweet. Ratio is between 0 point 5 and 4,

403
00:37:32.950 --> 00:37:39.710
Jason Liu: and so if you want 10,000 followers, you gotta just tweet like between, you know, tend to

404
00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:47.180
Jason Liu: 10 to like 5,000 times. That's my actual answer. Like, you just have to like practice like it's just reps in the gym.

405
00:37:47.540 --> 00:37:49.679
Jason Liu: I'll talk about the writing in a bit, too. But

406
00:37:50.910 --> 00:38:01.309
John Berryman: Well, maybe to see on the question a little bit more. Do you do anything like outside of directly tweeting to pull other authors into it, collaborate with others something that's gonna

407
00:38:01.380 --> 00:38:04.770
John Berryman: create some sort of a extra effect.

408
00:38:07.170 --> 00:38:11.470
Jason Liu: I used to quote Tweet more people. But Beckham.

409
00:38:11.660 --> 00:38:18.230
Jason Liu: most of it. Like most of the practice I want to be in having better skills and writing better tweets?

410
00:38:19.338 --> 00:38:21.730
Jason Liu: Because I think the other question is like.

411
00:38:21.890 --> 00:38:25.920
Jason Liu: Do you are you getting more followers? And are you actually getting more engagement from the retweet.

412
00:38:25.990 --> 00:38:27.559
Jason Liu: or you get more views.

413
00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:33.719
Jason Liu: But, like, you know, we, we really want to be paying for engagement enough for impressions.

414
00:38:34.430 --> 00:38:35.430
Jason Liu: Yeah. But

415
00:38:35.470 --> 00:38:40.940
Jason Liu: yeah, I mean, just like, yeah, replying to people is always helpful and like getting their attention. But

416
00:38:41.370 --> 00:38:48.250
Jason Liu: the bulk of the work has just been in like volume to get practice.

417
00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:50.559
Jason Liu: and then you get to a point where, like.

418
00:38:50.570 --> 00:38:54.279
Jason Liu: if you have a blog post, you want to promote, you know how to write a tweet that promotes that blog. Well.

419
00:38:54.360 --> 00:39:04.330
Jason Liu: and a lot of that again, is just like having a good hook and really promising a good reward in the blog post, because to click away from Twitter is a very big potential energy.

420
00:39:05.460 --> 00:39:07.120
Jason Liu: And so it's like it can't just be.

421
00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:13.909
Jason Liu: Here's something I played around like. It can't be like I play. I spent the past weekend playing around with like Chat Gbt.

422
00:39:14.260 --> 00:39:18.230
Jason Liu: like, unless you have a hundred 1,000 followers like that's basically going to do very little.

423
00:39:18.810 --> 00:39:22.579
Jason Liu: But if it's like, here's like some things I learned about prompting. o 1

424
00:39:22.910 --> 00:39:26.250
Jason Liu: that had gotten me like much better results. That's probably a little bit better.

425
00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:31.749
Jason Liu: Right versus like. Here are 3 things you can like put into your system, prompt right now to make o 1 better.

426
00:39:32.580 --> 00:39:39.050
Jason Liu: Right now you're addressing those like value variables while also foreshadowing the reward.

427
00:39:39.720 --> 00:39:42.540
Jason Liu: But yeah, I have. I have a blog post on that.

428
00:39:44.490 --> 00:39:45.660
John Berryman: I'll I'll look forward.

429
00:39:45.660 --> 00:39:46.170
Jason Liu: Yeah.

430
00:39:46.170 --> 00:39:46.989
John Berryman: Cool. Thank you.

431
00:39:47.250 --> 00:39:50.200
Jason Liu: No problem, no problem. Man, boxman.

432
00:39:51.830 --> 00:39:52.950
Jason Liu: That's right.

433
00:39:52.950 --> 00:40:03.659
Lakshman Nataraj: Thanks for everything so far. And and and just to add, like I did have a blog post on prompting. Oh, one. So it got a lot of hits.

434
00:40:05.810 --> 00:40:06.440
Lakshman Nataraj: So

435
00:40:06.680 --> 00:40:16.706
Lakshman Nataraj: yeah, I just wanted to ask if you have suggestion on like medium versus Linkedin versus like sub stack, or or towards data science. Any of these

436
00:40:17.530 --> 00:40:24.409
Jason Liu: Yeah, I mean, I like I mentioned before, I think it's really valuable to own the content and own your distribution.

437
00:40:24.810 --> 00:40:29.329
Jason Liu: So I think for me. It was easiest to get on Twitter first, st if it's Linkedin. That's totally fine.

438
00:40:29.450 --> 00:40:40.440
Jason Liu: But I think once you get some critical mass on Linkedin, it should be going to a block like a your own website, because your own website can have services links. You have, like different places to sell different products.

439
00:40:41.030 --> 00:40:47.549
Jason Liu: And then, once you have a enough of that, I'm very convinced that

440
00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:51.729
Jason Liu: having a newsletter is kind of like the best way forward, because then you can just directly target people

441
00:40:52.140 --> 00:40:57.999
Jason Liu: like, and and on top of that the the number of followers does not matter

442
00:40:58.400 --> 00:41:02.290
Jason Liu: like if you offered me a hundred 1,000

443
00:41:02.660 --> 00:41:07.490
Jason Liu: new like newsletter off of like like AI news

444
00:41:07.720 --> 00:41:12.779
Jason Liu: versus a 200 new person newsletter of all the Ctos in Silicon Valley.

445
00:41:13.300 --> 00:41:18.979
Jason Liu: I would probably pay like $80,000 for that email list. You know, there's no way I couldn't make one sale

446
00:41:20.980 --> 00:41:21.610
Jason Liu: right?

447
00:41:23.190 --> 00:41:31.420
Jason Liu: So so like it doesn't even matter like the volume. You have to figure out what the tam is, and the tam is defined by like the top of funnel content that you write.

448
00:41:31.870 --> 00:41:32.660
Jason Liu: you know.

449
00:41:32.840 --> 00:41:42.489
Jason Liu: if all your if all your blog posts are like how to use lane chain and like how to like, you know, build an agent. You're probably gonna get a hundred 1,000 page, like page views of people who are learning things.

450
00:41:44.540 --> 00:41:49.799
Jason Liu: but versus like how to write a job description for AI engineers is going to be like very few views.

451
00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:56.769
Jason Liu: but you can probably write that blog post and get like a 5,000 MRI draw board, spun up afterwards as a business.

452
00:41:56.970 --> 00:41:58.580
Jason Liu: It's a very different.

453
00:41:59.720 --> 00:42:05.930
Jason Liu: but I would really try to own your distribution as quickly as possible. Like my regret, basically is not using email sooner.

454
00:42:07.720 --> 00:42:08.330
Jason Liu: Yeah.

455
00:42:09.350 --> 00:42:10.690
Lakshman Nataraj: Thanks. Yeah. Thanks.

456
00:42:11.070 --> 00:42:12.560
Jason Liu: Yeah. Seth.

457
00:42:15.120 --> 00:42:25.809
Stef Druga: Thanks, Jason, a quick question about how you have conversations with companies that are trying to recruit you for full time, position, and convince them that you could contribute more as a consultant.

458
00:42:27.090 --> 00:42:32.671
Jason Liu: So earlier I could not. But now I can.

459
00:42:33.670 --> 00:42:42.410
Jason Liu: One thing is just like, look, you know, for 2 million dollars I'll join. I'm totally happy to join. I just want like a multiple of my current revenue. Right? But

460
00:42:42.740 --> 00:42:49.150
Jason Liu: I think also, I'm gonna give the answer. Given my current position, which is like

461
00:42:49.220 --> 00:42:56.399
Jason Liu: a little bit of like, you know, Internet fame and a little bit of like recruiting, which is, I have a lot of value by just

462
00:42:56.920 --> 00:43:00.669
Jason Liu: meeting everyone else in the in the space. Technically.

463
00:43:00.780 --> 00:43:09.700
Jason Liu: the fact that I know all the founders and the vendors, and I know all a bunch of different researchers that allows me to step outside of the business to create opportunities that

464
00:43:09.730 --> 00:43:20.839
Jason Liu: as an IC I'm not incentivized to create, you know, like I can probably add more value because I also just, you know, know, the founders of like the land chains and the Brain Trust. I can like make these instructions.

465
00:43:20.990 --> 00:43:23.839
Jason Liu: and that's a different kind of value than the inputs of my work.

466
00:43:25.250 --> 00:43:27.010
Jason Liu: That's kind of the short answer.

467
00:43:27.260 --> 00:43:32.160
Jason Liu: The the other answer, which I is like a lot more aggressive is

468
00:43:32.990 --> 00:43:37.859
Jason Liu: I also have, like my work is guaranteed. I'll give you the money back if I don't believe in what you're doing

469
00:43:38.420 --> 00:43:41.099
Jason Liu: and like that trump card to me is also very valuable.

470
00:43:41.170 --> 00:43:46.879
Jason Liu: It's like, look like the fact that I can. Just if if you don't do what I say, I'll just give you the money back.

471
00:43:47.240 --> 00:43:57.080
Jason Liu: you know, like I'm not scared of like being fired, because, like my goal is like, Be right like, I don't need these other incentives of like my visa to to push back on these things.

472
00:43:57.390 --> 00:44:05.710
Jason Liu: and you know I'm going to be able to say things to you as the external advisor, that I would not be able to say or feel comfortable, saying, as your employees

473
00:44:06.150 --> 00:44:11.899
Jason Liu: right, and one of the things I also do is I talk to your employees. And if I think something's wrong, I'm just gonna tell you

474
00:44:12.300 --> 00:44:17.920
Jason Liu: right, there's a different, you know, variables that you can pull that are, to me at least, going to be very valuable. Right?

475
00:44:18.840 --> 00:44:19.600
Jason Liu: It's like.

476
00:44:19.970 --> 00:44:27.470
Jason Liu: look, look! I don't think you should making this bet on this project, and I'm so serious about you making not making this back. I'll just give you the $40,000 back, like.

477
00:44:27.640 --> 00:44:29.329
Jason Liu: I really don't think this is the right path

478
00:44:30.310 --> 00:44:35.370
Jason Liu: right? It's very different than like feedback during your like 360. Review.

479
00:44:35.710 --> 00:44:36.460
Jason Liu: Right?

480
00:44:36.820 --> 00:44:38.460
Jason Liu: I take a vote of confidence.

481
00:44:39.640 --> 00:44:43.390
Jason Liu: Does that make sense. I don't know if that's like not specific enough. But oh.

482
00:44:43.390 --> 00:44:44.719
Stef Druga: That's great. Thanks.

483
00:44:44.860 --> 00:44:47.020
Jason Liu: Great. Thank you, Pablo.

484
00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:52.574
Pablo Unzueta: Hey, Jason, thanks so much for putting this together. I guess my my question is,

485
00:44:52.870 --> 00:44:55.480
Pablo Unzueta: I'm currently in Academia, specifically a postdoc

486
00:44:56.630 --> 00:45:15.259
Pablo Unzueta: combining Ml and chemistry, I guess. Do you have any tips on AI for science? Consulting? It seems like the type of writing I would do would be more for a technical audience which isn't really the money makers, or I guess in general, for everyone in this call, if you have any tips, please network with me. Shoot me a DM. I would love to hear your feedback.

487
00:45:17.140 --> 00:45:18.489
Jason Liu: Yeah, I mean.

488
00:45:20.790 --> 00:45:27.520
Jason Liu: it really depends on what you're trying to solve. Like, do you want to be applying like literally, the science that you've been learning like one of like.

489
00:45:27.900 --> 00:45:40.929
Jason Liu: I don't have the consulting. I do. I feel like I'm somebody else's high school science teacher. It's like, do you know what a hypothesis is. Let's do some AV tests. Let's add some error bars on these plots, and really think if your system is improving it right

490
00:45:41.400 --> 00:45:44.800
Jason Liu: like. I don't know if you want to be like a high school science teacher, but

491
00:45:46.030 --> 00:45:51.170
Jason Liu: that's kind of one angle you would take. The second angle is like is your goal to

492
00:45:52.430 --> 00:45:56.420
Jason Liu: be like an AI engineer at like Moderna, or

493
00:45:56.930 --> 00:45:59.409
Jason Liu: but yeah, like, like, what is what like, what.

494
00:45:59.410 --> 00:45:59.960
Pablo Unzueta: Yeah.

495
00:45:59.960 --> 00:46:01.790
Jason Liu: Actually look like for you. I would love to know.

496
00:46:02.380 --> 00:46:20.570
Pablo Unzueta: Yeah, I I guess I would love to be able to apply what I know. But I guess at the end of the day, right. I just kind of want to be my own boss and make my own schedule. So if it ends up being, you know, helping people with basic science principles. That also would work. But I I guess you know priority one is, you know, being my own boss priority. 2 would be.

497
00:46:20.570 --> 00:46:21.130
Jason Liu: Got it.

498
00:46:21.130 --> 00:46:22.809
Pablo Unzueta: Being able to apply what I've learned.

499
00:46:24.410 --> 00:46:25.499
Jason Liu: Yeah, I mean.

500
00:46:25.730 --> 00:46:31.390
Jason Liu: I feel like, if you just had even a handful of technical content that was aligned with the stuff you're doing.

501
00:46:32.550 --> 00:46:36.679
Jason Liu: I think it's hard for anyone to sort of click a very technical piece of research.

502
00:46:36.830 --> 00:46:39.530
Jason Liu: and if you offer to speak to them or speak to their team

503
00:46:40.740 --> 00:46:45.279
Jason Liu: like. I don't know why someone will get to the end of like a technical report and be like, no, I don't want this guy.

504
00:46:45.480 --> 00:46:50.219
Jason Liu: If I if I had the option right? And just like start talking to people

505
00:46:50.670 --> 00:46:54.140
Jason Liu: and really understand like what what their pains are.

506
00:46:54.550 --> 00:46:57.660
Jason Liu: cause I don't think I can. I don't know if I know what they are right now.

507
00:46:57.940 --> 00:46:58.700
Jason Liu: Alright!

508
00:46:58.950 --> 00:47:02.370
Jason Liu: Might be super specific of like, oh, we need to be able to like search

509
00:47:02.600 --> 00:47:09.359
Jason Liu: like gene sequences in large databases like we saw your blog post about this topic, and you know

510
00:47:09.880 --> 00:47:14.999
Jason Liu: I'll have to figure out what the content looks like, but I find it very hard to be unwilling to talk to

511
00:47:15.190 --> 00:47:16.240
Jason Liu: an expert.

512
00:47:17.410 --> 00:47:18.010
Jason Liu: Yeah.

513
00:47:18.010 --> 00:47:19.510
Pablo Unzueta: Gotcha. Okay? Well, thank you.

514
00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:20.890
Jason Liu: Bum.

515
00:47:21.080 --> 00:47:21.440
Andrew Chaffin: Sir.

516
00:47:21.440 --> 00:47:21.960
Jason Liu: Lucas.

517
00:47:21.960 --> 00:47:23.540
Andrew Chaffin: The host of this? Can I insert

518
00:47:23.700 --> 00:47:25.610
Andrew Chaffin: a random idea there real quick?

519
00:47:27.380 --> 00:47:30.500
Andrew Chaffin: I mean, I made a couple 1 million dollars on just like

520
00:47:30.530 --> 00:47:34.590
Andrew Chaffin: taking an hour and writing down like, what are the

521
00:47:34.850 --> 00:47:37.029
Andrew Chaffin: why is nobody doing these things?

522
00:47:37.150 --> 00:47:39.950
Andrew Chaffin: And then thinking, who are the people that should probably be doing that.

523
00:47:40.050 --> 00:47:43.459
Andrew Chaffin: and then just sending them an email and saying, Hey, why aren't you doing this?

524
00:47:44.302 --> 00:47:46.930
Andrew Chaffin: So that might be worth an hour? Sorry to interrupt.

525
00:47:47.220 --> 00:47:51.920
Jason Liu: No worries, no cold outbound is super super valuable. Yeah, this is. This is always very helpful.

526
00:47:54.167 --> 00:47:55.949
Jason Liu: Wait, I think someone, I think.

527
00:47:55.950 --> 00:47:57.200
Jason Liu: Yes, Lucas.

528
00:47:57.200 --> 00:47:57.950
Jason Liu: Yes, yes.

529
00:47:57.950 --> 00:47:59.560
Lucas Soares: Yeah, can you guys hear me?

530
00:48:00.870 --> 00:48:17.910
Lucas Soares: All right, perfect. So I'm going to try to be quick because I wrote it down. So I actually found it very useful this 1st webinar, because I actually started reading the Alex or Mosey book. It was cool to see it there. So I've been doing content on medium and Youtube for a while now.

531
00:48:18.080 --> 00:48:28.449
Lucas Soares: and that the thing I'm struggling with is kind of niching down like. For example, you mentioned the red course in the in the AI consulting course, which I think I follow both.

532
00:48:28.700 --> 00:48:38.219
Lucas Soares: And what I thought it was cool is kind of like the way that you created that little tunnel with the news, out with the the system of like the Tweets, and then the newsletter to like kind of see.

533
00:48:38.220 --> 00:48:39.080
Jason Liu: Yeah.

534
00:48:39.750 --> 00:48:57.600
Lucas Soares: And I feel like my challenge is exactly that I feel like on medium and Youtube. I have both like, I have content that it's way, too, spread on like very simple to deeply, deeply technical. And I also struggle with the incentives like in on Youtube. There's a lot of incentive towards like talking about basic you know how to do.

535
00:48:57.600 --> 00:48:57.960
Jason Liu: Yes.

536
00:48:57.960 --> 00:49:14.829
Lucas Soares: With Hpt and Claude, and then on writing, the deeper the technical article is, the more reward that I get, and then I feel like, if you had some inputs on how to systematically, systematically start to experiment with those to get to more focused niching down. That's my question.

537
00:49:14.830 --> 00:49:22.619
Jason Liu: I would honestly just take all the Youtube videos you have right now, and just put them in the cloud and turn them into like tiny blog posts

538
00:49:23.600 --> 00:49:24.829
Jason Liu: and just like.

539
00:49:25.310 --> 00:49:29.850
Jason Liu: throw them into the Internet. And the Internet will just vote on what is important. And then you.

540
00:49:29.850 --> 00:49:36.309
Lucas Soares: I have like somewhat of an automation that does something like that. But like I never actually get to publish those, I just kind of use them as like.

541
00:49:36.310 --> 00:49:37.150
Jason Liu: Yeah.

542
00:49:37.430 --> 00:49:52.659
Lucas Soares: I like what you said about the what you do to convert the tweets like circle back, and then like extract the insights, and that that's Tweet. Then experiment with the Tweets to get to blog post, because I usually just go on thoughts. And I kind of end up.

543
00:49:52.770 --> 00:49:53.620
Lucas Soares: you know. Do.

544
00:49:53.620 --> 00:50:02.740
Jason Liu: Yeah, I I have an automation that is like a massive prompt, where every call, every call I have with every customer gets extracted into like

545
00:50:03.420 --> 00:50:05.410
Jason Liu: like 2 blog post ideas.

546
00:50:05.740 --> 00:50:11.979
Jason Liu: So every Friday, I'll just basically review like 17 blog post ideas. And like, I think this one could be interesting.

547
00:50:12.170 --> 00:50:13.700
Jason Liu: and I'll write a tweet.

548
00:50:14.230 --> 00:50:17.929
Jason Liu: and then I'll get like, 700 views. And okay, this is not that interesting. Never mind.

549
00:50:17.970 --> 00:50:26.679
Jason Liu: And I run another tweet, and it would be like 200,000 views like, Oh, I should write a blog post on like how report generation is much more valuable than like generic Q. And a.

550
00:50:27.110 --> 00:50:28.319
Lucas Soares: Nice, and I've.

551
00:50:28.320 --> 00:50:35.340
Jason Liu: And I could have going down this thread. And now it's like, Oh, I'm going to go talk to like an investor whose thesis is going to be on like report generation.

552
00:50:35.480 --> 00:50:37.490
Jason Liu: Right? You can go like way high.

553
00:50:38.350 --> 00:50:50.109
Lucas Soares: No, no, that's that's perfect. The the last thing I was gonna say is that the the way that you do it? What what I thought was interesting. I did some of those stuff. But, for example, I found a lot of people wanted to know about rag locally

554
00:50:50.720 --> 00:51:02.609
Lucas Soares: through the system, but I didn't have this kind of like funnel like you're doing with the extracting, the insights, analyzing, seeing which works. And then tweet etc. So I'm definitely gonna try that out. Thanks. Thanks. A lot.

555
00:51:02.610 --> 00:51:04.729
Jason Liu: Yeah. Oh, yeah. Misha.

556
00:51:06.710 --> 00:51:12.573
Misha Granin: Yeah. Actually, I wanted to ask about the same thing general details of how you

557
00:51:13.060 --> 00:51:23.420
Misha Granin: exactly what you you told. Now that, as I understand you just not just give Tweet ideas. You 1st read all the drafts of the blog posts

558
00:51:23.740 --> 00:51:35.769
Misha Granin: that are generated calls. So you have a lot, because this is conflicting with what you said before, that generally Internet will digest and throw out all the garbage anyway. So for us.

559
00:51:36.220 --> 00:51:41.090
Misha Granin: as we are starting. It's better to just flood with all the content we have.

560
00:51:41.260 --> 00:51:52.390
Misha Granin: Then the second question is this your expertise? The trust was built with a specific tool. I was tinkering for like 2 and a half years. I have a lot of projects.

561
00:51:52.460 --> 00:51:59.069
Misha Granin: never published anything as open source. I know that marketing appropriate, properly marketing. An open source project is a big thing.

562
00:51:59.200 --> 00:52:05.310
Misha Granin: so like if my goal is to work on the Tam, which is Ctos of

563
00:52:05.520 --> 00:52:12.899
Misha Granin: like this series, a companies. What you think now at this moment is a good niche

564
00:52:13.130 --> 00:52:18.700
Misha Granin: to try to build something which will be valuable to build my

565
00:52:19.310 --> 00:52:25.720
Misha Granin: credibility. The trust? What kind of tools are needed now, because I've done everything from like

566
00:52:25.880 --> 00:52:30.440
Misha Granin: simple processing to, you know, developers, tools, and so on.

567
00:52:32.250 --> 00:52:36.810
Jason Liu: I think it's hard, because I don't really know what kind of conversations happen with those folks.

568
00:52:38.510 --> 00:52:50.609
Jason Liu: I feel. Yeah, I feel like you might have to give me more information on this, because, again, like the framework, is just like for me, the one I always use is like, you know, dream peace, success, time, value. It's like, what are things that are like? Too difficult, too slow.

569
00:52:50.630 --> 00:52:54.019
Jason Liu: too high risk and just sort of like

570
00:52:54.870 --> 00:53:00.149
Jason Liu: just brainstorm, like, I'm sorry. I don't really think I have, an I have the ability to give an answer right away. But

571
00:53:01.270 --> 00:53:13.659
Jason Liu: I would mostly just apply that framework and just see. Okay, how can I? How can I come with contacts? Context, give set up calls, and just kind of like spin this flywheel. And eventually a a useful thing came out right, like

572
00:53:13.980 --> 00:53:18.989
Jason Liu: the rag course took basically a year of the flywheel spinning to go. Okay.

573
00:53:19.290 --> 00:53:22.820
Jason Liu: I'm saying the same thing over and over again. I think I'm ready.

574
00:53:23.290 --> 00:53:26.859
Misha Granin: Was this course a goal because it was an amazing match.

575
00:53:28.640 --> 00:53:32.809
Misha Granin: You just understand that there is a demand for this product. Yeah.

576
00:53:33.050 --> 00:53:37.815
Jason Liu: Yeah, I just kept. I was like, I can't keep saying the same thing over and over again.

577
00:53:38.647 --> 00:53:40.350
Misha Granin: Right in sales.

578
00:53:40.350 --> 00:53:46.694
Jason Liu: And the blog is not enough. Right? The blog is not enough. I'll say one thing that has been very enlightening, which is

579
00:53:48.440 --> 00:53:52.930
Jason Liu: whatever you're doing and whatever you're selling, there's a version that costs 5 times more.

580
00:53:52.980 --> 00:53:54.689
Jason Liu: and if you can figure out

581
00:53:54.820 --> 00:54:01.290
Jason Liu: what that looks like and what you could deliver if you were able to take in 5 times more to figure out what the product looks like.

582
00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:08.110
Jason Liu: And so at that time, for, like 4Â HI was charging like $10,000.

583
00:54:08.490 --> 00:54:11.629
Jason Liu: So okay, so what's something that's like, 5 times the last that takes a month.

584
00:54:11.810 --> 00:54:14.200
Jason Liu: It's okay. So it's not like $2,000 like.

585
00:54:14.280 --> 00:54:16.880
Jason Liu: what can I deliver for $2,000 a month?

586
00:54:18.440 --> 00:54:21.639
Jason Liu: Okay? Like, it's not a book like, I'm not selling a book for $2,000.

587
00:54:23.100 --> 00:54:30.030
Jason Liu: But if I did like a 3 day workshop, I don't think that's worth $2,000 unless it was in person. But an online course, if you do like, that's just where the price fits.

588
00:54:30.220 --> 00:54:31.100
Jason Liu: Right?

589
00:54:31.390 --> 00:54:32.160
Jason Liu: Like.

590
00:54:32.320 --> 00:54:42.900
Jason Liu: if I ask, like, okay, if this course was 5 times cheaper, what would that look like, okay, maybe that's just a community. And maybe like, that's a weekly office hours where I don't have to prepare material. Maybe someone would be willing to pay

591
00:54:43.370 --> 00:54:45.040
Jason Liu: a hundred dollars a month for that.

592
00:54:45.310 --> 00:54:52.500
Jason Liu: So now you're trying to just figure out like what the what the portfolio looks like. That's how I usually, that's how I basically came to the course.

593
00:54:54.130 --> 00:55:00.409
Jason Liu: It's like, I want to double my consulting fee. So now there's like nothing here. There's a vacuum. Let me fill it in with something else.

594
00:55:05.370 --> 00:55:08.929
âš¡ Marian Noble (she/her): Jason. We wanna do announcements and wrap things up.

595
00:55:09.300 --> 00:55:13.059
Jason Liu: Yeah, we can do announcements first.st I'm happy to stay on a little bit. I know there's like a couple more questions.

596
00:55:13.060 --> 00:55:35.960
âš¡ Marian Noble (she/her): Okay, sweet, yeah. I just wanna let you all know that we will answer any questions that you guys still have lingering, or that come up after this in the questions channel. I know, because of all of the technical staff stuff that happened Jason will answer all those questions, so make sure that'll happen. And then on Wednesday we'll have the zoom capacity increased, and we'll have Slido in place, and everything will be great.

597
00:55:36.020 --> 00:56:00.509
âš¡ Marian Noble (she/her): We have a survey anonymous survey to answer all sorts of questions. You guys might be curious about yourselves in terms of where you are in the consulting and how you're doing things and all the sales process. And this will just be really good research to have anyways. So if you have questions that you would want us to include in that anonymous survey. Before we put it out you can find that survey channel in the slack.

598
00:56:00.920 --> 00:56:14.349
âš¡ Marian Noble (she/her): and then we also have one on one chat. So you guys can chat with each other if you'd like to take part in that, just join the Peer Chats Channel, and we'll be matching people up at 5 Pm. Tomorrow, Eastern.

599
00:56:15.720 --> 00:56:18.139
âš¡ Marian Noble (she/her): All right, go ahead and take it away. Jason.

600
00:56:18.420 --> 00:56:26.220
Jason Liu: Awesome cool. Who is next I love?

601
00:56:31.860 --> 00:56:33.009
Jason Liu: I think you're muted.

602
00:56:33.670 --> 00:56:39.336
Shalev: Sorry, enabling both. I was just wondering about. I actually just posted this in the slack.

603
00:56:39.730 --> 00:56:57.139
Shalev: I am curious about getting clients and making connections and such outside of the tech hotspots like Silicon Valley, where you said you kind of know everybody, and you've connected with founders and tech people all the time. If you live in a another portion of the world, is perhaps slower, paced, and not as intense.

604
00:56:57.140 --> 00:56:57.640
Jason Liu: Yep.

605
00:56:58.025 --> 00:57:07.274
Shalev: And maybe you're also trying to target you know what's available. Smaller businesses, not necessarily large enterprise shops or huge fast moving startups.

606
00:57:08.180 --> 00:57:13.780
Shalev: how can you still build a consultancy and get connections? And still, you know, find the right clients and those kinds of places.

607
00:57:14.460 --> 00:57:22.469
Jason Liu: Yeah. So when I started Twitter, I was actually just like stuck in Toronto waiting for my visa. It's kind of like a okay. Well, I'm actually super far away from everyone I know.

608
00:57:22.670 --> 00:57:27.729
Jason Liu: Let me do the Twitter thing versus like go to hackathons and whatnot. I do just think that

609
00:57:29.090 --> 00:57:34.589
Jason Liu: Twitter above. Linkedin is just a great place to meet people, because, like in the Tech hotspot, like everyone's already there.

610
00:57:34.840 --> 00:57:39.009
Jason Liu: like half the people I know. I don't even know their real names or what they look like.

611
00:57:39.700 --> 00:57:44.039
Jason Liu: And so there's a great opportunity to sort of build friendships that way. And then

612
00:57:44.060 --> 00:57:47.249
Jason Liu: the reason I know all these people is actually because of Twitter. Right?

613
00:57:47.650 --> 00:57:52.590
Jason Liu: So I had Rsi in 2020. And I basically stopped thinking about tech for like

614
00:57:52.600 --> 00:57:57.729
Jason Liu: 3 years until chattivity came out and I was able to write again, and I was able to use dictation.

615
00:57:58.500 --> 00:57:59.560
Jason Liu: And so

616
00:58:00.300 --> 00:58:11.490
Jason Liu: I think it's definitely possible you just have to figure out like what people want. You know what I mean like, I think if the way of getting more followers is just figuring out like, how can you help someone else accomplish their dreams? And you know.

617
00:58:12.420 --> 00:58:16.360
Jason Liu: if you can figure that out, everything else will follow.

618
00:58:17.453 --> 00:58:23.226
Shalev: Twitter or blues. I know a lot of folks are moving to blue sky now, do you work with that at all, or is it

619
00:58:23.684 --> 00:58:30.540
Jason Liu: No, I just do. I have enough of an audience where it's like not worth to do the platform change like I would rather go directly to email.

620
00:58:31.770 --> 00:58:32.580
Shalev: Like a Newsletter.

621
00:58:32.900 --> 00:58:38.249
Jason Liu: Yeah, exactly. Exactly. Cause. Then I own that list forever. And like, there's no platform risk.

622
00:58:39.010 --> 00:58:40.599
Jason Liu: Got it? Yeah, okay, thank you.

623
00:58:40.910 --> 00:58:48.050
Jason Liu: Yeah. But I would really figure out, yeah, like, what is the what are like? What is a portfolio of dreams? I can help people accomplish on the Internet.

624
00:58:48.170 --> 00:58:51.110
Jason Liu: And if I just write about those that content

625
00:58:51.200 --> 00:58:53.490
Jason Liu: match the value. But the the value equation.

626
00:58:53.570 --> 00:59:04.849
Jason Liu: You end up doing quite well, and if you want to make sure they follow you. You have to make sure the Cta is to follow you. I will say, if you say, Follow me afterwards, it's like 7 times more conversion.

627
00:59:05.310 --> 00:59:05.960
Shalev: Yeah.

628
00:59:06.290 --> 00:59:12.579
Shalev: Okay. But you had to bootstrap from from start, though. Right? So you had some Twitter followers, even in Toronto.

629
00:59:13.290 --> 00:59:17.260
Jason Liu: Yeah, from like 2,008 to 2023, I had 500 followers, I think.

630
00:59:17.880 --> 00:59:18.589
Shalev: And it worked for Matt.

631
00:59:19.090 --> 00:59:20.290
Jason Liu: Yeah, yeah.

632
00:59:20.290 --> 00:59:20.850
Shalev: Okay.

633
00:59:21.170 --> 00:59:34.949
Jason Liu: Yeah. But at that point I was like making a tweet every day of like, here's like a new like pytantic model you can use for like a structured extraction. Here's how you do it for receipts. And here's how you do it for, like photo, the receipts. And here's how you do it for like 15 different things. And I wrote like.

634
00:59:35.020 --> 00:59:39.790
Jason Liu: like a hundred pages of docs on instructor, and just like promoted every single one on like a circle.

635
00:59:40.390 --> 00:59:42.420
Jason Liu: Yeah, that's all.

636
00:59:43.710 --> 00:59:52.377
Vishal Patel: Yeah. Hi, my question is about the kind of optimal time allocation between content creation and doing actual client work.

637
00:59:53.520 --> 00:59:57.099
Vishal Patel: And let me kind of give you a little bit more context on where I'm coming from.

638
00:59:57.444 --> 00:59:57.790
Vishal Patel: So

639
00:59:57.790 --> 01:00:20.990
Vishal Patel: I'm a data science. AI consultant. And I've been running my own practice for the last 8 years. And I already have kind of more work than I can handle right now. I don't do content right now, but I would like to. I used to blog for personal hobby back in the day, so I'd like to get into content creation. But the thing I'm because of the opportunity cost of creating blogs and creating content.

640
01:00:21.180 --> 01:00:23.980
Vishal Patel: I'm trying to kind of think about how much time

641
01:00:24.220 --> 01:00:30.989
Vishal Patel: should I? And perhaps there's no one right answer to that. So maybe you can talk about at the beginning when you started this journey.

642
01:00:31.010 --> 01:00:35.489
Vishal Patel: How much time were you allocating to content creation, and how that has changed over time.

643
01:00:36.930 --> 01:00:38.620
Jason Liu: I would say, maybe like

644
01:00:38.980 --> 01:00:53.830
Jason Liu: 10 to 15% of my time was spent doing content creation, and most of the time was like building the libraries. For example, once I found out about like Circle Back and cal.com all that kind of stuff, I started more of a process, and I started hiring a writer

645
01:00:53.910 --> 01:00:55.250
Jason Liu: that's 1 angle of it.

646
01:00:55.490 --> 01:00:58.499
Jason Liu: Once I had proof that I was good at content creation

647
01:01:00.190 --> 01:01:07.149
Jason Liu: During the conversations with the startups I was working with. I realized that they kind of always are lacking this ability to be seen.

648
01:01:07.460 --> 01:01:11.069
Jason Liu: So I'm actually slowly rolling content creation into the business

649
01:01:11.430 --> 01:01:19.040
Jason Liu: right? And so now it's like, Oh, what are your goals like? What does success look like for you? So we're gonna raise our series? A, we're gonna hire a little bit more.

650
01:01:19.200 --> 01:01:27.087
Jason Liu: Okay? Do you think like writing about your technical work could attract more more people to apply for your job? Maybe cool. Cool.

651
01:01:27.450 --> 01:01:38.359
Jason Liu: What else would you need? Oh, you want more users cool like, are these technical users? Yes, great! What if we also, as through our consulting and figuring out what you want to build. Let's also write content on how to use the software.

652
01:01:38.650 --> 01:01:45.100
Jason Liu: And so I've been naturally and slowly biscuit like building up this like Dev Braille Agency on the side

653
01:01:45.200 --> 01:01:48.240
Jason Liu: which is actually safer for me to hire, for.

654
01:01:48.430 --> 01:01:50.720
Jason Liu: like I can hire like a

655
01:01:51.740 --> 01:01:58.520
Jason Liu: I can hire a writer much easier if I can hire like a AI consultant that I feel I'm comfortable, like delegating client work to.

656
01:01:59.220 --> 01:02:03.190
Jason Liu: But now I'm able to scale by just. You know, I just have 2 writers now.

657
01:02:03.830 --> 01:02:09.269
Jason Liu: and their job is sort of like, take my meeting notes and my loom videos and like, turn them into a blog post.

658
01:02:09.420 --> 01:02:14.099
Jason Liu: but I've actually been able to roll that into the business and and scale that a little bit better.

659
01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:16.100
Vishal Patel: Gotcha. Okay.

660
01:02:16.100 --> 01:02:21.030
Jason Liu: And I think maybe the angle is like, can you figure out a way to like

661
01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:24.980
Jason Liu: like? Add the option of writing as part of the engagement.

662
01:02:25.560 --> 01:02:26.100
Vishal Patel: Yeah.

663
01:02:26.100 --> 01:02:31.100
Jason Liu: And then you can like synchronously convert that content into to writing like now, during my calls.

664
01:02:31.260 --> 01:02:36.169
Jason Liu: If I think there's a blog idea, I'll just say the blog idea out loud during the call.

665
01:02:36.640 --> 01:02:39.810
Jason Liu: because the blog extractor will just catch it on the back end.

666
01:02:40.790 --> 01:02:41.450
Vishal Patel: Yep.

667
01:02:41.860 --> 01:02:47.519
Jason Liu: And then, if I like it, I'll just go. Hey? I think there was a good idea in the conversation we had last week.

668
01:02:47.720 --> 01:02:50.970
Jason Liu: Do you want to spend some time this week to write like spin that up instead?

669
01:02:51.820 --> 01:02:54.099
Jason Liu: I was like great cool. Let's cancel the meeting.

670
01:02:54.110 --> 01:03:01.240
Jason Liu: Spin this up. I'll send it to my writer. And then, like, here's a loom video that happened like interviewed me for an hour and a half, and then let's like come up with a blog post.

671
01:03:02.170 --> 01:03:02.970
Jason Liu: Yeah.

672
01:03:03.150 --> 01:03:04.659
Vishal Patel: Gotcha makes sense. Yep, thank you.

673
01:03:04.660 --> 01:03:06.120
Jason Liu: Yeah. Joe.

674
01:03:10.770 --> 01:03:12.500
Joe Kariuki: Hi! Can you guys hear me?

675
01:03:13.140 --> 01:03:13.790
Jason Liu: Yep.

676
01:03:15.170 --> 01:03:31.050
Joe Kariuki: Great good. Yeah, I think, 1st of all, I just want to just thank you for just putting these workshops together. I really appreciate. You know, you bringing in the value equation by Homozy, really big fan. So that was like really awesome to see. So my question is really just around.

677
01:03:31.420 --> 01:03:40.389
Joe Kariuki: you know how you just talked about like, you know, niche and like choosing the right like target market. So just to give a bit of more context. Earlier this year, I started a dev shop.

678
01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:45.710
Joe Kariuki: and we've been getting a like clients based off referrals. So like people who know me as I see

679
01:03:45.710 --> 01:03:48.170
Joe Kariuki: engineer then just refer work to us.

680
01:03:48.230 --> 01:04:09.005
Joe Kariuki: So I want to specialize more in just building AI powered applications. But so like the kind of people we've been getting as referrals have been primarily just like early stage entrepreneurs or founders who are looking to like build an Mvp. So my question really is around like, you know, what advice? Do you have around like working with those type of

681
01:04:09.598 --> 01:04:19.630
Joe Kariuki: individuals like those those specific type of entrepreneurs who want to like build an Mvp. And like sort of what are like the pros and cons of just like working with that specific type of market.

682
01:04:19.630 --> 01:04:23.589
Jason Liu: Okay, I can talk about this because I that was like the biggest lesson I learned

683
01:04:24.215 --> 01:04:32.790
Jason Liu: the most aggressive thing I would say is, people with Mvps have no pains like it's hard to figure what the pain is you're like a nice to have.

684
01:04:32.950 --> 01:04:35.600
Jason Liu: And so it was really good when I was charging like

685
01:04:35.740 --> 01:04:40.880
Jason Liu: $5,000 a month for like a like 4Â h of meetings, plus like asynchronous access.

686
01:04:40.940 --> 01:04:48.810
Jason Liu: and then something would get busy, and then I'd be like, Hey, you still there like, do you still want to talk like it's like, Oh, we're we're busy with like hiring and fundraising.

687
01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:56.500
Jason Liu: So one thing I would say is, if you can figure it out how to do like multi-month engagements.

688
01:04:56.970 --> 01:04:58.960
Jason Liu: It's gonna make your life much easier.

689
01:04:59.240 --> 01:05:10.340
Jason Liu: So here's here's a failure mode. If you do something where you charge 5 or $10,000 a month, and then all of a sudden, they have a fire, or they're having some like founder arguments, or they're like, you know, fundraising.

690
01:05:10.360 --> 01:05:14.039
Jason Liu: You get a slow month, and then the question becomes, will they churn or not?

691
01:05:14.260 --> 01:05:14.765
Jason Liu: Right?

692
01:05:15.470 --> 01:05:22.230
Jason Liu: Or it's like, Oh, we have some tech issues. And now you like, do you pause it? Do you refund this month? And then it's very annoying.

693
01:05:22.480 --> 01:05:27.599
Jason Liu: But if you can figure out some way of figuring it, okay, sure, I'm gonna charge you $5,000 a month. But

694
01:05:27.920 --> 01:05:31.739
Jason Liu: if you just raised money and you think we're going to work together for about 5 months?

695
01:05:31.990 --> 01:05:38.839
Jason Liu: Let's do a $25,000 engagement where we do 50 upfront, and then 50 in 60 days, or something like that.

696
01:05:38.950 --> 01:05:43.430
Jason Liu: or you can pay upfront for 15% off right?

697
01:05:43.660 --> 01:05:46.329
Jason Liu: And then what happens is, if there's any drama

698
01:05:46.590 --> 01:05:51.130
Jason Liu: you can say, Hey, it looks like you 2 are really busy. I'm happy to extend the engagement for a month.

699
01:05:52.870 --> 01:05:55.830
Jason Liu: and then they thank you right.

700
01:05:56.260 --> 01:05:57.030
Joe Kariuki: Yeah.

701
01:05:57.030 --> 01:06:00.920
Jason Liu: Whereas before it's like, Hey, we haven't talked because you're like super busy. Should I like like

702
01:06:01.530 --> 01:06:06.310
Jason Liu: like? Is it? So? I refund you for the $7,000 we didn't do anything and like, I don't wanna like.

703
01:06:06.760 --> 01:06:20.479
Jason Liu: be this like very extractive. And you just have a bunch of different feelings that are like, not needed, at least for me. So that's the 1st thing right fixed engagement time. And then, if something good happens, you can renegotiate a new engagement

704
01:06:20.510 --> 01:06:22.330
Jason Liu: because the 5 months ended.

705
01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:28.360
Jason Liu: So, good. Crit, you raise your series a let like, does it make sense to continue this and and do something else

706
01:06:29.270 --> 01:06:35.500
Jason Liu: right? And then you can like raise prices, decrease prices, change the engagement. It's much more natural than just having a subscription that runs

707
01:06:37.300 --> 01:06:42.720
Jason Liu: and then, lastly, depending on how confident you are, there is a world where you ask to be paid on success.

708
01:06:43.400 --> 01:06:44.420
Jason Liu: Right?

709
01:06:44.450 --> 01:06:52.419
Jason Liu: Do you want, like like $25,000 to build a prototype, or you say, Oh, I want a hundred $1,000, but like if you raise, then you pay me the 80

710
01:06:52.820 --> 01:06:53.340
Jason Liu: right.

711
01:06:54.290 --> 01:07:01.780
Jason Liu: But now I know what you want is to raise. If you need me to talk to customers, I'm willing to do that, and if you need me to do something else. I'm willing to do that, too.

712
01:07:02.500 --> 01:07:06.186
Jason Liu: But there's there's there's a there's a spectrum that you can play around with.

713
01:07:06.500 --> 01:07:08.660
Jason Liu: It really depends on where where people are.

714
01:07:09.800 --> 01:07:13.739
Jason Liu: Yeah. But those are. Do those 3 things make sense.

715
01:07:14.590 --> 01:07:17.129
Joe Kariuki: Yeah, it does. Makes it very clear. Thank you.

716
01:07:17.130 --> 01:07:18.283
Jason Liu: Yeah, like,

717
01:07:20.200 --> 01:07:26.130
Jason Liu: yeah. Like, I think if you're doing a monthly retainer, it's no different than charging hourly, like, it has to be

718
01:07:26.700 --> 01:07:29.920
Jason Liu: $40,000 over 5 months, right?

719
01:07:30.030 --> 01:07:35.319
Jason Liu: Because it takes 5 months to get there. It's not because my time is worth dollar over hour amount.

720
01:07:36.080 --> 01:07:36.720
Joe Kariuki: Right?

721
01:07:37.170 --> 01:07:50.870
Joe Kariuki: Yeah. So like, right now, I, I do charge based on the project. So like, sort of what you basically said like a fixed price, and then you also offer like support on a monthly fee as well. So like post project, offer support on a monthly fee, as well.

722
01:07:52.430 --> 01:07:56.750
Jason Liu: Yeah, maybe the next level is, can we figure out some kind of like engagement where it's

723
01:07:57.230 --> 01:07:59.049
Jason Liu: on success, or something like that?

724
01:07:59.830 --> 01:08:01.729
Joe Kariuki: Right, right.

725
01:08:03.040 --> 01:08:03.560
Jason Liu: Christy.

726
01:08:04.510 --> 01:08:27.609
Cristi Vicas: Yes, thank you for this course. And hopefully, I'm not in the wrong chat. Yeah, because I think it's a bit of a noob question we signed a client. And what's the difference between what we do? And what an individual contributor or technical lead, or even a manager does. Are there any red lines areas where we don't go into

727
01:08:28.090 --> 01:08:31.150
Cristi Vicas: keep our hands off some things?

728
01:08:32.130 --> 01:08:33.250
Cristi Vicas: So basically.

729
01:08:33.250 --> 01:08:34.010
Jason Liu: One walking.

730
01:08:34.010 --> 01:08:37.129
Cristi Vicas: Be our day job in interaction with the client.

731
01:08:37.810 --> 01:08:40.130
Jason Liu: One thing that I was like the

732
01:08:40.740 --> 01:08:47.200
Jason Liu: like a generic red flag is like I try not to join their slack channel, and I don't.

733
01:08:47.640 --> 01:08:52.290
Jason Liu: I don't participate in the stand up. If I am, I am running the stand up.

734
01:08:53.390 --> 01:08:59.299
Jason Liu: Yeah, because he had to preserve some optics of not being an employee right and like

735
01:08:59.350 --> 01:09:03.519
Jason Liu: like the the communication with me, has to go through like a much more narrow path.

736
01:09:04.010 --> 01:09:10.959
Jason Liu: and if you do that, then it becomes a lot easier like, because if you're on the slack and you see a question like, should I answer this question right now, like, what's going on

737
01:09:10.970 --> 01:09:16.679
Jason Liu: right, if you're like on, stand up. It's like an hour a week of just you not saying anything listening to them.

738
01:09:17.300 --> 01:09:22.939
Jason Liu: And then you start looking like a an employee that's like, though that's like the one core thing that I've sort of realized

739
01:09:23.040 --> 01:09:27.389
Jason Liu: is always a slack connect or be invited in separate groups

740
01:09:27.520 --> 01:09:30.800
Jason Liu: and make sure you have like a key contact.

741
01:09:30.920 --> 01:09:36.070
Jason Liu: and that you are not sort of in the same position as as a as a employee

742
01:09:36.359 --> 01:09:42.196
Jason Liu: like for one Comp. Company. I was part of like the 3 60, like Quarterly Review, and I was like, Wait a minute like

743
01:09:42.750 --> 01:09:45.529
Jason Liu: I messed up right.

744
01:09:45.779 --> 01:09:51.679
Cristi Vicas: Okay, thank you. So absolutely no problem. Getting hands dirty with code and tweaking things around.

745
01:09:52.250 --> 01:09:56.500
Jason Liu: Yeah, I think there depends on how big your company is. For example.

746
01:09:57.370 --> 01:09:59.920
Jason Liu: like, when I work with one like

747
01:10:00.240 --> 01:10:08.940
Jason Liu: 1 billion dollar company, they're like, okay, like, you need to install all this like security software on your laptop. We're not gonna send you a new laptop. Here's like sign all this paperwork

748
01:10:09.369 --> 01:10:12.330
Jason Liu: but also, you have to like, contribute to the code base.

749
01:10:12.380 --> 01:10:29.740
Jason Liu: But you can't get access to like the vercel environment variables like email me once a week to get the new rotated keys. That kind of stuff gets really tricky. What I do now is, I just say I will build prototypes, and I'll deliver them over the wall. But I will not be contributing to the core code base, because I don't want to. One waste time

750
01:10:29.850 --> 01:10:33.510
Jason Liu: onboarding the complexity of the code base. And then 2

751
01:10:34.540 --> 01:10:38.870
Jason Liu: because I'm not working a full full time role with you.

752
01:10:39.120 --> 01:10:45.749
Jason Liu: like if I'm missing an Api key and I message somebody, and they're busy with 3Â h like the cycles get way way longer than they ought to be.

753
01:10:46.170 --> 01:10:49.620
Jason Liu: whereas prototyping and handing it over is, I think, a better quote

754
01:10:49.650 --> 01:10:52.460
Jason Liu: program for for me at least, as as an individual.

755
01:10:54.330 --> 01:10:55.040
Jason Liu: Oh.

756
01:10:58.800 --> 01:10:59.770
Jason Liu: does that make sense.

757
01:11:00.140 --> 01:11:01.250
Cristi Vicas: Yes, thank you. Awesome.

758
01:11:01.250 --> 01:11:01.880
Jason Liu: Awesome.

759
01:11:02.220 --> 01:11:03.010
Jason Liu: Done.

760
01:11:05.140 --> 01:11:29.200
Ben: Yeah. My question. Similar vein. It's managing implementation versus advisory. And how to manage that trade off. So obviously, I think the stuff that you talked about. Content? Can be a big difference in what you attract? And the less business you have, the more you're gonna go towards implementation. But the more time you spend on implementation, the less time you have to

761
01:11:29.290 --> 01:11:48.010
Ben: write, better content and get more advisory, higher leverage things. So could you just talk in some more detail about how you've navigated that and how you transition like, yeah, I don't know if it's really possible to transition an implementation client to an advisory one. You probably just have to find new ones, but.

762
01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:53.820
Jason Liu: It depends. So I'll say 3 things. The 1st one is.

763
01:11:54.600 --> 01:11:58.509
Jason Liu: implementation is very good in the beginning, because it actually is

764
01:11:59.010 --> 01:12:02.130
Jason Liu: like the work like it actually gets you content to write about.

765
01:12:02.420 --> 01:12:07.420
Jason Liu: So if you think about the rad course, most of the anecdotes of the Rad course came from the implementation work

766
01:12:08.020 --> 01:12:11.649
Jason Liu: right? And so like, you need to actually

767
01:12:12.020 --> 01:12:23.530
Jason Liu: have been right to write content where you are right. If you just start with advisory work, there's actually no proof that you you've you've had any regrets, or you can minimize any regrets. So implementation is a very good way to start out.

768
01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:25.189
Jason Liu: The second thing is

769
01:12:25.260 --> 01:12:29.890
Jason Liu: depending on how you scope the projects. If it is implementation work, I scope it as

770
01:12:29.960 --> 01:12:38.810
Jason Liu: you guys need a prototype very soon. Hiring is very difficult. I'm going to step in to help you get to this prototype in order to raise raise money. For example.

771
01:12:40.510 --> 01:12:44.559
Jason Liu: benefit 2 is, I will help you interview and hire my replacement.

772
01:12:45.100 --> 01:12:48.980
Jason Liu: and then I will step back and act as an advisory for the role.

773
01:12:49.170 --> 01:13:03.900
Jason Liu: So as my proposal, because I know what you want is not a prototype. What you want is to have some bigger outcome. You can add options in to upsell hiring, interviewing selection and then transitioning to an advisory role later on in some in the timeline

774
01:13:05.860 --> 01:13:18.339
Jason Liu: But that's only because you know what they actually want. You know that what they actually want is not just a prototype, but something much bigger, and you can add options as part of that, and we'll talk a little bit more about that. In Day 3, we go over proposals where?

775
01:13:18.600 --> 01:13:28.729
Jason Liu: Yeah, almost every company I work with has an option where it's like, Hey, I'm going to help you write. But it's gonna push towards hiring. We're gonna head ahead of AI. And then the ultimate goal is, I get you a roadmap. Get to series a

776
01:13:29.070 --> 01:13:29.820
Jason Liu: right?

777
01:13:30.760 --> 01:13:36.459
Jason Liu: And because the vision is so big, everything else can is just the implementation detail of whether you're implementing or advising.

778
01:13:39.270 --> 01:13:40.110
Jason Liu: Evan.

779
01:13:40.680 --> 01:13:47.879
evan david: Hi, Jason, thanks so much for this is amazing. I'm leaving a corporate job as a head of AI after

780
01:13:48.520 --> 01:13:51.130
evan david: very long time, and I already won my 1st

781
01:13:51.270 --> 01:14:03.352
evan david: big consulting client like a large tech media company. They want me to come in and help them amplify their usage of AI for their developers and build proof of concepts and kind of show people best practices.

782
01:14:03.670 --> 01:14:04.160
Jason Liu: Yeah.

783
01:14:04.160 --> 01:14:16.070
evan david: But they were very loose on the proposal, like they wanted it to be less specific, and they kept kind of dodging, like what success looks like. So I'm just. I'm I'm kind of scared because I.

784
01:14:16.430 --> 01:14:17.010
Jason Liu: Yeah.

785
01:14:17.010 --> 01:14:30.440
evan david: Stuff to develop content. I want to own the content. I think it's gonna get tricky from an IP standpoint. But I'm just wondering, like, what would you look out for, or what would you? How would you think about it? Going into this in like 2 to 3 weeks?

786
01:14:32.500 --> 01:14:36.870
evan david: And it's a high hourly rate for 6 months, that they've locked me in.

787
01:14:37.760 --> 01:14:39.370
Jason Liu: And it is hourly still.

788
01:14:39.370 --> 01:14:42.039
evan david: It is hourly, and they're pushing for like

789
01:14:42.070 --> 01:14:48.260
evan david: pretty much full time, like they want me full time at this hourly rate, which I'm cool with, because I want their name.

790
01:14:48.670 --> 01:14:49.310
Jason Liu: Right.

791
01:14:49.520 --> 01:14:51.049
evan david: And I want the experience.

792
01:14:51.860 --> 01:14:59.590
Jason Liu: Yeah, the IP stuff is tricky, like, my loophole is basically for a lot of the prompt engineering work. It's a part of instructor.

793
01:15:00.380 --> 01:15:08.880
Jason Liu: And then in my contract, it says, like, I will use like open source tooling. And I'll reference documentation of open source tooling and the blogs go into the documentation.

794
01:15:10.010 --> 01:15:18.830
Jason Liu: So it's like all of it is like pre-existing IP, because I'm going everything through instructors like a loophole. There. The second thing is like, yeah. Just hire a lawyer. I I'm gonna invite Luke

795
01:15:19.280 --> 01:15:23.780
Jason Liu: who is like my new lawyer to come in and maybe talk to people. But.

796
01:15:25.020 --> 01:15:26.250
evan david: I need a lawyer.

797
01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:29.570
Jason Liu: The IP stuff is really tricky and like that was

798
01:15:29.670 --> 01:15:32.735
Jason Liu: that was basically like $1,600 for me to just figure out that like.

799
01:15:33.490 --> 01:15:35.869
Jason Liu: if it's in the instructor, Vlog, it's okay.

800
01:15:36.370 --> 01:15:36.870
evan david: Okay.

801
01:15:36.870 --> 01:15:40.230
Jason Liu: As long as it's not like super unrelated.

802
01:15:41.370 --> 01:15:44.460
Jason Liu: But I'll say, if if it is an hourly rate.

803
01:15:44.970 --> 01:15:47.550
Jason Liu: it's less risky, I would say.

804
01:15:48.530 --> 01:15:49.380
Jason Liu: But

805
01:15:49.820 --> 01:15:55.259
Jason Liu: but again, the question I would always ask is like, Okay, what's at stake in the business? What are we celebrating a year from now?

806
01:15:55.990 --> 01:15:59.640
Jason Liu: Do you? Can you have any answer? And if you they don't have any answer.

807
01:16:02.380 --> 01:16:07.039
Jason Liu: it's still a little bit of a red flag. I think the only question is like. Do you want the logo and like.

808
01:16:07.140 --> 01:16:11.250
Jason Liu: do you want like, be given hourly? You're you're kind of de-risked in some ways.

809
01:16:11.630 --> 01:16:15.900
evan david: Got it. Well, what sold them was that I basically talked to them about

810
01:16:16.335 --> 01:16:25.470
evan david: Turbo charging innovation, utilizing AI, and with, you know, cause the even though they're large, they still have a limited budget. Everybody's cutting back

811
01:16:25.610 --> 01:16:28.838
evan david: so amplifying the power of research and.

812
01:16:29.680 --> 01:16:30.760
Jason Liu: So, yeah.

813
01:16:31.400 --> 01:16:38.700
Jason Liu: yeah. And Wednesday, I'll talk a little bit more about how to have the value conversation. But even that feels very, very challenging. Right?

814
01:16:38.700 --> 01:16:39.150
Jason Liu: Okay,

815
01:16:39.650 --> 01:16:42.150
evan david: Alright. Well, thank you. This is awesome.

816
01:16:42.150 --> 01:16:45.850
Jason Liu: Maybe message me on site. Maybe we can brainstorm and figure out how to that makes sense

817
01:16:45.850 --> 01:16:47.222
Jason Liu: bit better. But

818
01:16:47.890 --> 01:16:48.430
evan david: Appreciate it.

819
01:16:48.430 --> 01:16:49.840
Jason Liu: Yeah, ours is always tricky.

820
01:16:50.900 --> 01:16:51.440
evan david: Okay.

821
01:16:51.440 --> 01:16:59.679
Jason Liu: Yeah, because the trick for me is like, Hey, look, you know, I wanna be talking to your team. I don't want your team to be making some investment decision every time they message me on slack. So let's just do

822
01:16:59.930 --> 01:17:04.760
Jason Liu: like a project with based plan. And let's really figure out like, what does success look like?

823
01:17:04.950 --> 01:17:06.410
Jason Liu: That's kind of like. How I.

824
01:17:06.720 --> 01:17:07.110
evan david: Got it.

825
01:17:07.110 --> 01:17:09.569
Jason Liu: Wordsmith, my way into the value, conversation.

826
01:17:09.570 --> 01:17:11.510
evan david: Okay. Alright, that's helpful.

827
01:17:12.220 --> 01:17:13.160
evan david: And I.

828
01:17:14.570 --> 01:17:26.389
Nik McFly â€” Hybrain.ai: Yeah, one more question is, so we have very good tech specialists team. And we have some experience in our products along with

829
01:17:26.630 --> 01:17:34.070
Nik McFly â€” Hybrain.ai: local rags and stuff, very different things from avatars and marketing campaigns to industrial applications and.

830
01:17:34.070 --> 01:17:34.780
Jason Liu: Hmm.

831
01:17:34.780 --> 01:17:40.410
Nik McFly â€” Hybrain.ai: Business process automation. So if you were in our position.

832
01:17:40.520 --> 01:17:59.870
Nik McFly â€” Hybrain.ai: which product would you recommend focusing on as an agency what would be the one that delivers the greatest value to clients makes them eager to pay, and is realistically achievable. Any ideas, or maybe trends you've spotted, or

833
01:18:00.410 --> 01:18:01.320
Nik McFly â€” Hybrain.ai: any answer.

834
01:18:01.820 --> 01:18:06.866
Jason Liu: Yeah, I feel like my answer. There would mostly be like using the Internet as a sensor.

835
01:18:08.030 --> 01:18:08.950
Jason Liu: Right?

836
01:18:09.700 --> 01:18:10.670
Jason Liu: That's like.

837
01:18:11.470 --> 01:18:19.949
Jason Liu: because I now have, like the rag audience and the consulting audience. There is a world where I can just like, send everyone an email, do a survey and figure out, oh, wow like

838
01:18:20.110 --> 01:18:24.780
Jason Liu: software that turns meeting in a blog post could be like a thing that we're willing to pay for

839
01:18:25.060 --> 01:18:27.329
Jason Liu: right? But

840
01:18:29.380 --> 01:18:35.899
Jason Liu: I don't know if I have. I could like, put a bet on any of these, any of these things I would just figure out like.

841
01:18:38.130 --> 01:18:48.909
Jason Liu: and I mean another way to think about. It's like, Okay, well, how if I go down any of these paths like, what does my life look like in a year from now? What is the thing we celebrate. And then how easy is it to actually get that audience

842
01:18:48.930 --> 01:18:51.210
Jason Liu: top of funnel right?

843
01:18:51.320 --> 01:18:56.849
Jason Liu: It's like, Can you? If you can write the marketing line better for one of these products. I think that's something that would be

844
01:18:56.960 --> 01:18:59.119
Jason Liu: very interesting to to note.

845
01:19:00.830 --> 01:19:05.947
Jason Liu: yeah, in in the past, like 10 years I've been doing like physics and like deep learning. And the marketing brain has,

846
01:19:06.760 --> 01:19:08.249
Jason Liu: has been very enlightening.

847
01:19:10.140 --> 01:19:13.989
Jason Liu: Yes, what is the biggest outcome that you can feel accountable for with the tool that you built.

848
01:19:14.200 --> 01:19:20.190
Jason Liu: and then for that audience, is there a way that you can build a campaign to get that? Get that right? Attention.

849
01:19:20.600 --> 01:19:21.340
Jason Liu: Yeah.

850
01:19:21.690 --> 01:19:24.230
Jason Liu: But just yeah. Message me on slack. We can brainstorm this as well.

851
01:19:25.140 --> 01:19:26.140
Jason Liu: Okay.

852
01:19:26.480 --> 01:19:31.894
Jason Liu: it is 1230 on my end. I think we're gonna let's just wrap this up now and then.

853
01:19:32.430 --> 01:19:38.549
Jason Liu: yeah. So I'll send a letter of apology to the the other 70 people I missed out on office hours.

854
01:19:41.160 --> 01:19:43.280
âš¡ Marian Noble (she/her): Thank you so much, Jason.

855
01:19:44.860 --> 01:19:45.550

856
01:19:45.790 --> 01:19:47.019
Sid: Take care, everyone.

857
01:19:47.020 --> 01:19:47.549
Sid: Thank you. Guys.

858
01:19:47.550 --> 01:19:48.000
Jason Liu: Bye, bye.

859
01:19:48.920 --> 01:19:49.680
Evan Simpson: Thanks, everybody.
