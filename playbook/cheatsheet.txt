# **Consulting Accelerator Cheat Sheet**

*Your quick-reference guide to attract the right leads, communicate value, and close higher-value consulting deals.*

### 1. Shift Your Mindset

- **From Inputs to Outcomes:** Stop selling hours. Focus on delivering measurable business results.
- **Be a Partner, Not a Vendor:** Understand what’s truly at stake for the client’s business—revenue, retention, time-to-market, or competitive advantage—and position yourself as the solution, not just extra hands on deck.

### 2. Qualify the Buyer & Uncover What’s at Stake

- **Qualified Buyer Test:** Can they say “yes” without checking with someone else? Do they understand the broader business impact? If not, find the real decision-maker.
- **Ask What’s at Stake:** “If we fail to solve this, what’s the cost to your business? Revenue lost? Missed funding? Churned customers?” Their answer reveals the true value of your work and guides your pricing.

### 3. Value Equation & ROI Focus

Use the value framework to tailor your pitch:

**(Dream Outcome × Probability of Success) ÷ (Time + Effort)**

- **Dream Outcome:** Clarify their end goal—enter a new market, raise a funding round, reduce churn, improve MRR.
- **Probability of Success:** Show how your involvement, tools, case studies, or frameworks increase their odds of succeeding.
- **Time & Effort:** Highlight how you’ll shorten timelines, ease implementation burdens, and free their team to focus on high-level work.

### 4. Content as Proof & Top-of-Funnel Strategy

- **Earn Trust Early:** Publish blog posts, guides, and newsletters that address real business pains, not just technical tips.
- **Demonstrate Expertise:** Case studies, whitepapers, and newsletters focusing on hiring pitfalls, go-to-market strategies, or evaluation frameworks prove your credibility.
- **Long-Term Asset:** Your content library is “proof” that precedes you—by the time prospects talk to you, they already trust your insights.

### 5. The Situational Assessment Proposal

Structure every proposal to first emphasize their situation and outcomes, then present fees. Use these sections:

1. **Situation:** Summarize their current state, the key challenges, and the stakes involved. Show you understand their urgency and pain.
2. **Objectives & Metrics:** Be explicit about success criteria. Are we cutting onboarding time by 50% or reducing churn by 20%?
3. **Value & Benefits:** Highlight the ROI. Connect solving their challenge to raising more capital, increasing ARR, or reclaiming staff hours. Include intangible benefits like trust, competitive edge, or peace of mind.
4. **Methodology & Accountability:** Outline your approach, who’s responsible for what, and how frequently you’ll communicate. Make clear you’re accountable for delivering results—not just activities.
5. **Options & Investment:** Present 3 tiers:
    - **Advisory (Baseline):** Limited calls, strategic guidance.
    - **Comprehensive (Mid-Tier):** Deeper involvement, hands-on help, training their team.
    - **Premium (High-Touch):** White-glove service, access to your expert network, workshops, top-priority support.

Anchor your price against the value you create, not the hours you spend.

### 6. Pricing & Guarantees

- **Value-Based Fees:** Tie your pricing to project outcomes, milestones, or business impact.
- **Reduce Risk with Guarantees:** Consider refund clauses if value isn’t delivered, or milestone-based billing to show confidence and integrity.
- **Upsell with Extras:** Offer add-ons like direct access to an expert network, facilitated hiring, or additional reporting to increase perceived value and justify higher fees.

### 7. Closing the Deal

- **Set Expectations Early:** After the initial call, confirm when you’ll send the proposal and schedule a follow-up meeting right away.
- **Show Confidence:** Because you’ve done the legwork—uncovered what’s at stake, aligned on outcomes, and connected fees to value—your proposal speaks their language. They’ll see you as an indispensable partner, not an expense.

### 8. Iteration & Continuous Improvement

- **Debrief Every Conversation:** Review call transcripts, identify questions you missed, and refine your pitch.
- **Content Feedback Loop:** Let ongoing client conversations inspire your next blog posts or newsletters. Over time, this attracts more qualified leads who already “get” you.
- **Keep Upgrading Your Offers:** Experiment with new tiers, improved guarantees, and updated proposals as you learn more about what clients truly value.
