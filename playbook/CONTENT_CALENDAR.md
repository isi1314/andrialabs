# CONTENT STRATEGY & CALENDAR

**Purpose:** Generate qualified leads through strategic content that demonstrates expertise and attracts the right buyers

**Core Philosophy:** Content is proof that precedes you - by the time prospects call, they already trust your insights

---

## CONTENT PRINCIPLES

### 1. Write for Qualified Buyers, Not General Audience

**Target Reader:** CTOs, VPs of Engineering, Chief AI Officers, Product Leaders
**NOT:** Junior engineers, students, general tech audience

**This means:**
- Focus on business outcomes, not just technical details
- Discuss ROI, costs, and strategic implications
- Address buying concerns (how to evaluate consultants, when to build vs. buy)
- Show you understand their pressure and constraints

### 2. Demonstrate Strategic Thinking, Not Just Technical Skills

**Good:** "Why Your $500k AI Initiative Will Fail (And How to Fix It)"
- Shows you understand common failure patterns
- Positions you as strategic advisor
- Attracts people with $500k budgets

**Bad:** "How to Fine-Tune GPT-3.5 With Python"
- Technical tutorial anyone can write
- Attracts people looking for free DIY help
- Doesn't differentiate your strategic value

### 3. Content Should Generate Discovery Calls

**Every piece should:**
- Address a problem worth $50k+ to solve
- Demonstrate your unique expertise
- Include a clear call-to-action
- Build trust through transparency and specificity

**Avoid:**
- Generic advice available everywhere
- Content that fully solves the problem (give framework, not implementation)
- Topics that don't relate to your services
- Clickbait or controversial takes for engagement

## CONTENT PRODUCTION PROCESS

### Weekly Rhythm

**Monday:**
- Outline this week's blog post
- Schedule research/interviews if needed
- Plan distribution strategy

**Tuesday-Wednesday:**
- Write blog post
- Create supporting graphics/charts
- Edit and refine

**Thursday:**
- Publish blog post
- Create 5 LinkedIn snippets from post
- Write newsletter email
- Schedule social posts

**Friday:**
- Promote blog post

### Writing Tips

**Hook Formula:**
- Start with surprising statistic or bold claim
- Example: "73% of enterprise AI projects fail"
- Example: "Your $500k AI initiative is probably doomed"
- Example: "RAG systems don't work (at least not the way you built yours)"

**Structure:**
1. **Hook** (1 paragraph) - grab attention
2. **Problem** (2-3 paragraphs) - establish pain
3. **Framework** (60% of post) - your systematic solution
4. **Examples** (20% of post) - case studies, specific tactics
5. **CTA** (final 2-3 paragraphs) - clear next step

**Voice:**
- Direct and confident (not apologetic)
- Specific over generic (numbers, names, details)
- Contrarian where appropriate (challenge common wisdom)
- Helpful but not comprehensive (give framework, not full implementation)

**Length:**
- Blog posts: 2000-3500 words (substantial, not surface-level)
- LinkedIn posts: 1500-3000 characters (long enough for insight, short enough to read)
- LinkedIn snippets: 300-600 characters (scroll-stopping)

7. **PDF download** (gated lead magnet for email capture)

**Example:**
Blog post: "The 30-Day AI Evaluation Framework"

→ LinkedIn Post 1: "Most teams ship AI without knowing if it works. Here's Week 1 of the fix..."
→ LinkedIn Post 2: "How to build golden datasets (the right way)"
→ LinkedIn Post 3: "LLM-as-judge: when it works, when it fails"
→ Email: "New framework: Evaluate AI features before shipping"
→ PDF: "30-Day AI Evaluation Checklist" (email capture)
→ Infographic: Visual timeline of the framework

**Result:** One 3000-word blog post = 20+ pieces of content

## FINAL CONTENT WISDOM

**Volume beats perfection:**
- Published and imperfect > perfect but unpublished
- Aim for "very good" not "perfect"
- You'll get better by doing

**Consistency beats intensity:**
- One post every 2 weeks for a year > 10 posts in a month then nothing
- Build sustainable rhythm
- Content compounds over time

**Value beats promotion:**
- Focus on genuinely helping your audience
- Promotion feels natural when content is valuable
- Your best marketing is remarkable work

**Strategic patience:**
- Content takes 3-6 months to generate meaningful leads
- First posts won't go viral - that's okay
- Building authority is a long game

**Start now:**
- Week 1 post ideas are ready to go
- You have the expertise
- Your buyers are searching for answers you can provide
- The only thing between you and leads is clicking "publish"

**Now go write.**
