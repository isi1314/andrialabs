# PRICING CALCULATOR & DECISION FRAMEWORK

**Purpose:** Systematic approach to pricing consulting engagements based on value, not hours

**Core Principle:** Price is determined by (1) value at stake, (2) complexity, (3) timeline, and (4) your unique capability to deliver

---

## PRICING PHILOSOPHY

### The Fatal Mistake: Pricing Based on Your Costs

**DON'T DO THIS:**
```
My time is worth $X/hour
× Y hours needed
= $Z price
```

**This fails because:**
- Penalizes your expertise (you solve problems faster)
- Caps your income at hours available
- Focuses client on your inputs, not their outcomes
- Commoditizes you ("why pay you when I can get someone cheaper?")

### The Right Approach: Value-Based Pricing

**DO THIS:**
```
Value at stake for client: $X
Your fee: 10-30% of value delivered
= Price that feels proportional
```

**This works because:**
- Aligns your incentives with client success
- Rewards your expertise and efficiency
- Positions you as investment, not expense
- Justifies premium pricing

---

## PRICING FORMULA

### Step 1: Calculate Total Value at Stake

**Downside Protection (What they lose if they fail):**
- Direct costs: $____________
- Lost revenue: $____________
- Wasted time/resources: $____________
- Competitive disadvantage: $____________
- Career/political risk: $____________

**Upside Opportunity (What they gain if they succeed):**
- Revenue increase: $____________
- Cost savings: $____________
- Time savings: $____________
- Competitive advantage: $____________
- Strategic positioning: $____________

**TOTAL VALUE AT STAKE:** $____________ to $____________

### Step 2: Determine Your Value Capture %

**General Guidelines:**

| Value at Stake | Your Capture | Rationale |
|----------------|--------------|-----------|
| $50k - $200k | 20-30% | Smaller projects, higher % |
| $200k - $500k | 15-25% | Mid-size, proportional |
| $500k - $2M | 10-20% | Large projects, volume pricing |
| $2M+ | 5-15% | Enterprise, even small % is significant |

**Adjustment Factors:**

**Increase your % if:**
- You're one of few people who can solve this (+5-10%)
- Timeline is urgent (+5-10%)
- High risk if they fail (+5-10%)
- They have no alternative (+5-10%)
- You have strong proof of similar successes (+5%)

**Decrease your % if:**
- Many consultants could do this (-5-10%)
- Timeline is flexible (-5%)
- They have internal capability to do most of it (-5-10%)
- You're learning/building case study (-10-20%)
- Strategic partnership potential (lower price, gain case study, network access, etc.)

### Step 3: Calculate Base Price

```
Total Value at Stake × Your Capture %
= Base Price Range
```

**Example:**
- Value at stake: $800k
- Your capture: 15%
- Base price: $120k

### Step 4: Tier Structure

**Create three tiers anchored around base price:**

**Tier 1 (Advisory):** 25-35% of base price
- Strategic guidance only
- Client executes implementation
- Lower touch, lower price

**Tier 2 (Comprehensive):** 100% of base price ⭐
- Strategy + hands-on execution
- This is your "recommended" tier
- Full involvement

**Tier 3 (Premium):** 140-160% of base price
- Everything + extra value (expert network, priority, extended support)
- Clear additional value justification
- Anchors high to make Tier 2 feel reasonable

**Example:**
- Base: $120k
- Tier 1: $40k (Advisory)
- Tier 2: $120k (Comprehensive) ⭐ RECOMMENDED
- Tier 3: $180k (Premium + Expert Network)

## PRICING DECISION TREE

### Question 1: What's the value at stake?

- **< $100k:** Consider if worth your time, or structure as advisory-only
- **$100k - $500k:** Strong fit, price at 15-25% ($15k - $125k)
- **$500k - $2M:** Premium engagement, price at 10-20% ($50k - $400k)
- **> $2M:** Enterprise deal, price at 5-15% ($100k+)

### Question 2: What's your level of involvement?

**Advisory Only (Strategic guidance, they execute):**
```
Base Price × 0.25 to 0.35
Monthly retainer: $15k - $25k
Minimum: 3 months
```

**Comprehensive (Strategy + hands-on execution):**
```
Base Price × 1.0
3-month engagement: $60k - $120k/month
Project-based: $180k - $360k total
```

**Premium (Comprehensive + extras):**
```
Base Price × 1.4 to 1.6
Add expert network, priority support, extended term
3-month engagement: $85k - $180k/month
```

### Question 3: What's the timeline?

**Standard (3-4 months):**
- Use base pricing formula

**Accelerated (6-8 weeks):**
- Add 15-25% urgency premium
- Justify: "Compressing typical timeline requires dedicated focus"

**Extended (6+ months):**
- Consider monthly retainer model
- Potentially lower monthly rate with longer commitment
- Volume discount: 10% off for 6+ month commitment

### Question 4: What's your competitive position?

**You're one of few who can solve this:**
- Price at high end of range
- Emphasize unique expertise
- Don't discount

**Multiple options available:**
- Price competitively but don't be cheapest
- Differentiate on value, not price
- Consider added value (guarantee, expert network) vs. price cut

**They're shopping on price:**
- Probably not qualified buyer
- Educate on value vs. cost
- Be willing to walk away

## DISCOUNT STRATEGY

### When to Offer Discounts

**GOOD REASONS:**
1. **Prepay discount:** 10-15% off for paying full amount upfront
   - Improves your cash flow
   - Shows client commitment
   - Standard practice

2. **Long-term commitment:** 10% off for 6+ month engagements
   - Guarantees revenue
   - Deeper partnership
   - More impact

3. **Referral discount:** 10-15% off for client referred by existing client
   - Rewards referrers
   - Lower acquisition cost
   - Pre-qualified lead

4. **Portfolio building:** 20-30% off if you have no case studies yet
   - Only for first 2-3 clients
   - Must get testimonial, case study, referrals
   - Strategic investment in your business

**BAD REASONS:**
1. ❌ Client asked for discount (train them to negotiate)
2. ❌ Competitor is cheaper (compete on value, not price)
3. ❌ You're desperate for revenue (shows weakness)
4. ❌ You feel guilty about high price (mindset problem)
5. ❌ End of month/quarter (arbitrary timing)

### How to Handle Discount Requests

**"That's more than we budgeted"**

Response:
> "I understand. Let me ask - what were you expecting the investment to be? [Get their number]
>
> Here's how I'm thinking about this: You mentioned [X] is at stake. My fee is [Y]% of that value. If we succeed, you'll see [Z]x ROI. The question isn't whether you can afford to work together - it's whether you can afford not to.
>
> That said, if budget is a constraint right now, we could start with the Advisory tier to prove value, then expand if it's working."

**"Can you do it for [lower number]?"**

Response:
> "I appreciate the question. My pricing reflects the value I deliver and my track record of [specific results]. If I discount significantly, I'd need to reduce scope, which would compromise the outcome you're looking for.
>
> What I can offer is [prepay discount, or alternative tier]. Would that work?"

**"We found someone cheaper"**

Response:
> "That's great - I'm confident you'll find the right fit. I'm curious though - what made you reach out to me in the first place? [Let them answer - they'll remind themselves why you're valuable]
>
> The difference between me and [cheaper option] is [your unique value]. Given what's at stake - [their risk] - the question is whether saving [price difference] is worth the additional risk of not getting the outcome."

## PRICING CONFIDENCE BUILDERS

### Overcome Your Own Pricing Anxiety

**Common fear:** "They'll think I'm too expensive"

**Reality:** If they understand the value at stake and you're 10-25% of that value, you're proportional

**Reframe:**
- You're not expensive, you're an investment
- Your high price signals high value (discounts signal low confidence)
- Qualified buyers expect to pay for expertise
- You're preventing 5-10x your fee in mistakes

**Practice saying out loud:**
> "The investment for the comprehensive engagement is $120,000 over three months."

Say it until it feels normal, not scary.

### Build Pricing Confidence Through Proof

**Collect and remember:**
- Every $ of value you've delivered
- Every disaster you've prevented
- Every timeline you've compressed
- Every ROI you've generated

**Example:**
> "I recently helped a client reduce their LLM costs from $45k/month to $12k/month - that's $396k annual savings. My fee was $95k. That's 4x ROI in year one."

When you know your value, you can charge for it.

**Test 3: Guarantee**
- Try "90-day value guarantee" in half of proposals
- vs. no guarantee in other half
- Track conversion rates

**Test 4: Payment Terms**
- Try "10% discount for prepay"
- vs. "50/50 split"
- See which clients prefer
