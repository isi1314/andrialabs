---

## üìà KEY INSIGHTS FROM ANALYSIS

### What Makes You Different

**Your Unique Value:** PhD in CS (research rigor) + 10+ years production experience (shipping ability) = rare combination

**Market Position:** You bridge academic AI research and production systems - most consultants are one or the other, not both

**Target Clients:** Series A-B startups, enterprise AI initiatives, product pivots with $100k+ budgets

---

### Critical Website Changes Needed

**Current Problem:** Website sells capabilities (what you do) instead of outcomes (what clients achieve)

**Top 3 Fixes:**

1. **Rewrite service descriptions** - Lead with ROI and business outcomes
   - Example: "Strategic AI Roadmapping That Prevents $100k+ Mistakes" instead of "AI Strategy & Advisory"

2. **Add case studies** - Three anonymized examples included in report
   - Show proof before prospects call you

3. **Three-tier pricing** - $18k/month (Advisory), $65k/month (Comprehensive), $95k/month (Premium)
   - Anchoring effect makes middle tier feel reasonable

---

### Your First 90 Days

**Week 1:** Website messaging overhaul + first blog post
**Weeks 2-4:** Case studies, pricing structure, content momentum
**Months 2-3:** Lead generation through content + outreach
**Expected:** 5-10 discovery calls, 1-2 proposals, first deal closed

**Revenue Target:** $83-90k in first 90 days (realistic with execution)
