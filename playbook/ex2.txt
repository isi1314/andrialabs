# Example Proposal 2

## Situation Appraisal

The company has begun a major initiative to integrate advanced AI capabilities into its CRM allow an automatically updating CRM based on customer interactions using LLMS, facing several key challenges:

- Processing over 200,000 emails per minute requires robust, scalable AI solutions, While cost is not the biggest concern now, we still expect to run into scaling hurdles if we do not build systems that are conscious of these limitations.
- Extracting valuable insights from both emails and call transcripts is needed to create a self-updating CRM, effectively building a memory system based on customer interactions.
- Capitalizing on the company's ecosystem to deliver integrated AI solutions that outperform narrow, single-purpose AI tools in the market.
- Balancing innovation with stringent legal and privacy requirements.
- Leveraging existing infrastructure and llm training capabilities to accelerate development

The current state of email signature extraction is functional but limited. The vision of a self-updating CRM that automatically enriches itself based on all communication data remains unrealized. This engagement aims to bridge that gap.

## Objectives

1. Develop a scalable prototype for processing call transcripts and automatically updating the CRM.
2. Implement prototype features including structured extraction for sentiment analysis, intent detection, and identifying objections and other key elements of customer interactions.
3. Create a framework for a self-updating CRM that minimizes manual data entry and provides superhuman recall for uncovering business insights and client opportunities.
4. Establish a foundation and culture for ongoing AI integration and experimentation, staying ahead of point-solution competitors.
    1. Implement synthetic data generation.
    2. Create a tight evaluation loop using human preferences and LLMs as judges.
    3. Identify UX improvements for better data collection.
    4. Define objectives for a data flywheel to collect evaluations and fine-tuning data.

## Metrics

Success will be measured by:

1. Delivery of a functional prototype in partnership with Colin, 
2. Accuracy and relevance of extracted insights, benchmarked against human preference.
3. Positive feedback from the the company team on knowledge transfer and usability.

## Value

Successful implementation of this project will:

- Accelerate the company's AI Insights timeline by months, avoiding wasted time on researching best practices for implementation, experimentation, and design
- Provide a competitive edge against AI-native point solutions, securing the company
- 's market position.
- Increase the value proposition of the company's CRM through automatic, intelligent updates, potentially driving significant revenue growth.

## Methodology and Options

### Option 1: Advisory

This option provides high-level strategic guidance without hands-on implementation:

- Monthly strategy sessions with leadership
- Weekly 1:1 sync with Tech Lead and PM to address blockers and discuss potential experiments
- Deliverables include written memos and small-scale prototypes on a weekly basis

### Option 2: Comprehensive

1. Rapidly prototype call transcript processing, leveraging my experience with Limitless AI and NaroHQ

This option includes:

- Availability on T, W, Th for ad-hoc meetings and collaborative work.
- Bi-weekly strategy meetings to align on progress and tackle roadblocks.
- Hands-on pair programming sessions to accelerate development and knowledge transfer.
- Development of prototype systems using test data to ensure compliance.
- Comprehensive research memos, training material, prototypes and documentation for knowledge transfer.

### Option 3: Comprehensive + Expert Network

This option includes everything in Option 1, plus:

- Access to talks, sessions, and workshops for the company teams, led by top AI experts from my network
- Help in setting up long-term partnerships or advisory roles between the company and these experts, if needed
- ***Selected Expert Network (Click to Expand)***
    
    Jason can coordinate Experts can be invited to speak to the team, contribute to research memos to make recommendations. Other experts include core maintainers of llm training libraries and other related fields to help unblock and accelerate development.
