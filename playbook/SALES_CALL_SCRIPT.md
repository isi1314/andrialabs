# SALES CALL SCRIPT & QUALIFICATION GUIDE

**Purpose:** Guide discovery calls to qualify buyers, uncover what's at stake, and position your value

**Duration:** 45-60 minutes

**Goal:** Determine if there's a fit, understand their situation deeply, and schedule proposal follow-up

---

## PRE-CALL PREPARATION (15 minutes)

**Research Checklist:**
- [ ] Company size, funding stage, industry
- [ ] Review their website/product
- [ ] LinkedIn research on the person you're talking to
- [ ] Any recent news, funding, or product launches
- [ ] Identify potential AI use cases relevant to their business

**Mindset:**
- You're assessing fit, not convincing them to hire you
- Your goal is to understand what's at stake, not to pitch
- If it's not a fit, gracefully exit and save both of your time
- Qualified buyers want expertise, not availability

## CALL STRUCTURE

### 1. OPENING (5 minutes)

**Set the tone as an expert consultant, not a vendor:**

> "Thanks for taking the time today. I've looked at [company name] and [specific observation about their business/product]. Before we dive in, let me share how I typically structure these conversations:
>
> I'll spend most of our time understanding your situation, what you're trying to achieve, and what's at stake. Then I'll share my initial thoughts on whether and how I can help. If it seems like a good fit, I'll put together a detailed proposal for our next conversation.
>
> Sound good?"

**Then, establish context:**

> "To start, can you give me the 2-minute version of what prompted this conversation? What's the AI challenge or opportunity you're facing?"

---

### 2. QUALIFY THE BUYER (10 minutes)

**Critical Questions - These determine if you continue:**

**Q1: Decision Authority**
> "Just to make sure we're using our time well - are you the person who can say 'yes' to moving forward on this, or are there others involved in the decision?"

**Strong Answer:** "Yes, I have budget authority" or "I need to align with [CFO/CEO], but I drive the decision"
**Weak Answer:** "I'll need to present to a committee of 7 people" → Be cautious

**Q2: Budget Reality**
> "Have you allocated budget for this initiative, or is this more exploratory at this stage?"

**Strong Answer:** "Yes, we have $X budgeted for this quarter/year"
**Weak Answer:** "We don't have budget yet, but we're interested" → Not qualified yet

**Q3: Timeline**
> "What's driving the timing on this? Why now versus six months from now?"

**Strong Answer:** Specific deadline, event, or business pressure
**Weak Answer:** "Just exploring" or "No rush" → Not urgent = not qualified

**Q4: Previous Attempts**
> "Have you tried to solve this internally or with other consultants? What happened?"

**Insight:** Reveals their pain points, budget history, and what didn't work

---

### 3. UNCOVER WHAT'S AT STAKE (15 minutes)

**The most critical part of the call - this determines your value and pricing**

**Q5: Failure Cost**
> "Let's talk about the stakes here. If this problem doesn't get solved, or if this initiative fails, what's the actual cost to the business?"

**Listen for:**
- Specific dollar amounts ("$50k/month in wasted spend")
- Revenue impact ("We'll miss our Q4 revenue target")
- Strategic risk ("We'll lose competitive advantage to AI-native competitors")
- Career risk ("The board is watching this closely")

**Probing deeper:**
> "Help me understand the math there - how did you get to $[X] impact?"

> "Beyond the direct cost, what else is at risk? Customer trust? Team morale? Market position?"

**Q6: Success Upside**
> "On the flip side, if this succeeds, what does that unlock for the business?"

**Listen for:**
- Revenue growth
- Cost savings
- Market differentiation
- New product capabilities
- Team scaling

**Q7: Urgency Factors**
> "What happens if this takes 12 months instead of 3 months? What's the cost of delay?"

**This reveals:** How much they value speed (which you provide)

---

### 4. UNDERSTAND THE TECHNICAL SITUATION (10 minutes)

**Q8: Current State**
> "Walk me through what you've done so far. What's working? What's not?"

**Listen for:**
- Technical debt or wrong approaches
- Missing evaluation systems
- Cost issues
- Accuracy problems
- Team capability gaps

**Q9: Team & Resources**
> "Tell me about your team - who's working on this? What are their backgrounds?"

**Assess:**
- Do they have technical capability to execute (affects which tier you propose)
- Team size (affects your level of involvement needed)
- Skill gaps (where you add value)

**Q10: Constraints**
> "What constraints should I be aware of? Regulatory, privacy, technical limitations, legacy systems?"

**This reveals:** Complexity factors that affect pricing and approach

---

### 5. EXPLORE PAST SOLUTIONS & OBJECTIONS (5 minutes)

**Q11: Why Not DIY?**
> "You have smart engineers - why bring in outside help rather than solving this internally?"

**Listen for:**
- Speed ("We don't have time to figure this out")
- Expertise ("We don't have AI expertise in-house")
- Strategic ("We need proven frameworks, not experiments")
- Political ("Executive mandate to get external validation")

**Q12: Competitive Concerns**
> "Are you talking to other consultants or considering other solutions?"

**If yes:**
> "That makes sense. What are you looking for that you haven't seen yet?"

**Insight:** What they value, how to differentiate

---

### 6. ESTABLISH ROI EXPECTATIONS (5 minutes)

**Q13: Investment Appetite**
> "Based on what you've shared - [summarize the stakes] - what kind of investment do you think is appropriate to ensure success?"

**If they give a range:**
> "That's helpful. And if we can deliver [outcome they want], would that feel like a strong ROI?"

**If they don't know:**
> "Let me give you a sense of how I think about this. Based on the [X] impact you described, a typical engagement in this scope runs [range]. Does that feel proportional to the value at stake?"

**This tests:** Budget reality and value mindset

---

### 7. YOUR INITIAL ASSESSMENT (5 minutes)

**Now you share your perspective:**

**If it's a strong fit:**

> "Based on what you've shared, I think I can help. Here's what I'm hearing:
>
> [Summarize situation] - You're facing [problem] with [X] at stake
>
> [Restate their goal] - Success looks like [outcome] by [timeline]
>
> [Your unique value] - This is exactly the type of challenge where my research-to-production approach works well. I've solved similar problems for [relevant example].
>
> Here's what I'd suggest: I'll put together a detailed proposal that outlines the situation, success metrics, and 2-3 different ways we could work together depending on your priorities.
>
> I'll typically present Advisory, Comprehensive, and Premium options so you can choose what fits best.
>
> How does that sound?"

**If it's borderline:**

> "I want to be direct with you. Based on what you've shared, I think you might be able to solve this internally with the right framework. Let me send you [resource/framework] that might help.
>
> If you try that and get stuck, or if the situation becomes more urgent, let's reconnect."

**Why this works:** Shows integrity, and they'll remember you when it does become urgent

**If it's not a fit:**

> "I really appreciate you sharing all of this. To be honest, I don't think I'm the right fit for this particular challenge. What you need is [more appropriate solution/consultant type].
>
> Would it be helpful if I introduced you to someone who specializes in that?"

**Why this works:** Protects your time, builds goodwill, might get reciprocal referrals

---

### 8. NEXT STEPS & CLOSE (5 minutes)

**If proceeding to proposal:**

> "Great. Here's what happens next:
>
> 1. I'll send over a detailed proposal by [specific date - usually 3-5 days]
> 2. Take a few days to review it
> 3. Let's schedule a follow-up call for [specific date] to walk through it and answer questions
> 4. If we both agree it's a fit, we can kick off as early as [date]
>
> Does that timeline work for your [initiative deadline]?"

**Schedule the follow-up NOW:**
> "Let's get that follow-up call on the calendar now while we're together. What works better for you - [day] at [time] or [day] at [time]?"

**Information gathering:**
> "For the proposal, I'll need [any additional information]. Can you send that over by [date]?"

**Final question:**
> "Before we wrap, is there anything I didn't ask about that's important for me to know?"

## COMMON OBJECTIONS & RESPONSES

### Objection 1: "That's more than we budgeted"

**Response:**
> "I understand. Let me ask - what were you expecting the investment to be? [Let them answer]
>
> Here's how I'm thinking about this: You mentioned [X] is at stake. My fee is [Y]% of that risk. If we succeed - which I'm confident we will based on [proof] - you'll see [ROI]. If we don't succeed, you can use my guarantee.
>
> The real question isn't whether you can afford to work together - it's whether you can afford not to."

**Alternative:**
> "What if we started with the Advisory tier to prove value, with the option to expand if it's working?"

### Objection 2: "We need to think about it"

**Response:**
> "Absolutely, this is an important decision. Just so I can help - what specifically do you need to think about? Is it budget, timeline, or something about the approach?"

**[Get the real objection, then address it]**

### Objection 3: "Can you just do [small piece]?"

**Response:**
> "I could, but I'd be doing you a disservice. Here's why: [small piece] won't solve [big problem they shared]. What you really need is [comprehensive solution].
>
> If budget is the concern, we can structure the Advisory option to get started with a smaller commitment. But let's make sure we're solving the right problem."

### Objection 4: "We found someone cheaper"

**Response:**
> "That's great - competition is healthy. I'm curious though - what made you reach back out to me? [Let them answer - they'll sell themselves on your unique value]
>
> The difference between me and [cheaper option] is [unique value: research background, proven frameworks, speed, guarantee]. The question is: given what's at stake with [their risk], is saving [price difference] worth the additional risk?"
