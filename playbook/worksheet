# Alternative AIDA Worksheet

This worksheet helps you refine your consulting offer and messaging. You’ll use the Value Equation to define a compelling offer, identify who you’re speaking to and where they hang out, and then apply AIDA to craft a short pitch. Lastly, you’ll consider how to iterate on your messaging by experimenting online—writing multiple tweets to test hooks, repurposing them into blog posts, and learning as you go.

**Key Idea:**

- The internet is your testing ground. Don’t aim for perfection on day one. Post multiple versions of the same idea as Tweets, see which gains traction, then expand that successful version into a blog post.
- It’s all about “imperfect action.” Your goal is to learn what resonates, refine your copy, and gradually dial in on what works.

## Step 1: Apply the Value Equation

**Context:**

Using the Value Equation (Dream Outcome, Likelihood, Time, Effort/Risk), you’ll shape an offer that stands out. For example, if you promise to help founders launch AI MVPs faster, show that you’ve done it before, shorten the time to launch, and remove pain points like hiring complexity.

**Questions to Ask:**

- What result do my clients truly dream of?
- How can I prove to them they can trust me?
- How quickly can I deliver tangible progress?
- How do I eliminate complexity and uncertainty?

**Your Answers:**

**Dream Outcome:**

(e.g., “Launch your AI MVP in under 30 days so you can impress investors and raise funding sooner.”)

`_____`

**Perceived Likelihood of Achievement:**

(e.g., “Showcase testimonials, a track record of 5+ successful rapid MVP launches.”)

`_____`

**Time to Value:**

(e.g., “From idea to working prototype in less than a month.”)

`_____`

**Effort & Risk:**

(e.g., “I handle all technical integration and offer a no-questions-asked guarantee.”)

`_____`

**One-Sentence Offer:**

Combine these elements into one compelling line.

(e.g., “I help early-stage AI startups build a working MVP in under a month—backed by real case studies—so they can raise funding faster, minus the hiring headaches.”)

## Step 2: Identify Message Platform & Audience

**Context:**

Your audience and platform choices matter. If you want to reach technical founders, Twitter or niche Slack channels might be great. For enterprise leaders, LinkedIn or targeted emails may be better.

**Questions to Ask:**

- Who specifically benefits most from my offer?
- Where do they spend their time online?
- What kind of content do they prefer (short tweets, blog posts, videos, case studies)?

**Your Answers:**

**Audience (TAM):**

(e.g., “CTOs of seed to Series-A AI startups”)

`_____`

**Preferred Platforms:**

(e.g., “Active on Twitter, LinkedIn, and a private AI founders Slack group”)

`_____`

**Content Style & Format:**

(e.g., “Short, data-backed tweets and brief blog posts with clear examples.”)

`_____`

## Step 3: Present the Offer Using AIDA

**Context:**

AIDA (Attention, Interest, Desire, Action) helps you craft a compelling short pitch. For example:

- **Attention:** “Tired of missing investor deadlines with your AI MVP?”
- **Interest:** “My 30-day MVP framework gets you a launch-ready prototype fast.”
- **Desire:** “Wow investors, raise sooner, and skip the complex hiring.”
- **Action:** “Book a free call to see if we’re a fit.”

**Questions to Ask:**

- How will I grab their attention right away?
- What’s special about my approach?
- How do I make them really want this outcome?
- What’s the simplest next step?

**Your Answers:**

**Attention (Hook):**

`_____`

**Interest (Why It’s Unique):**

`_____`

**Desire (Outcomes & Proof):**

`_____`

**Action (Next Step):**

`_____`

### Draft Your Final AIDA Message

Combine the AIDA elements into 2–4 sentences suitable for your chosen platform.

**Example:**

“Struggling to ship your AI MVP on time? My proven 30-day framework delivers a working prototype—no hiring hassles. Impress investors, secure funding faster, and stop wasting cash on guesswork. Book a free 15-min call to learn more.”

**Your Turn:**

## Using the Internet as Your Testing Ground

**Context:**

- **Experimentation Over Perfection:**
Test your messaging by writing multiple tweets conveying the same idea in different ways. See which version gets better engagement (likes, replies, clicks).
- Turn the best-performing tweet into a blog post that dives deeper.
- Monitor how your audience responds to the blog post—what questions do they ask? What objections arise?
- Use these insights to refine your offer sentence and AIDA pitch over time.

**Practical Steps:**

1. Write 3–5 tweet variations of your “Attention” hook.
2. Post them over a week, track engagement.
3. Double down on the one that resonates most, and expand it into a short blog post explaining your process and including a call-to-action.
4. Gather feedback, refine, repeat.

**Questions to Ask:**

- What did people respond to most?
- Which wording triggered curiosity or clicks?
- How can I expand on that to provide more detail in a blog post?

**Your Plan:**

- List one idea you’ll test as multiple tweets:`_____`
- How often will you post and track results?`_____`
- Which metric matters most to you (clicks, replies, sign-ups)?`_____`

## Next Steps

1. **Publish & Test:** Use your chosen platform to share your AIDA message.
2. **Iterate via Micro-Experiments:** Run quick tests on social media (tweets) to find the best-performing copy.
3. **Repurpose & Expand:** Turn successful tweets into blog posts or newsletter content.
4. **Refine Continuously:** Update your offer and messaging based on real-world feedback.

Remember: It’s not about being perfect. It’s about imperfect action—testing, learning, and improving step-by-step.
