# Andria Labs Website - Deployment Summary

## What Was Done

### 1. Navigation & Footer Cleanup ✅
- Removed all "Protected Page" broken links from 7 HTML files
- Removed "Style Guide" broken links
- Verified all footer links point to real pages
- **Status:** Complete and deployed

### 2. Homepage Simplification ✅
- Hidden 7 empty/incomplete sections using CSS `!important` rules:
  - Partner section (partner logos)
  - Counter section (statistics)
  - Pricing section (not ready yet)
  - Testimonial section ("Why Our Customers Love Working With Us")
  - Our Recent Work section (empty)
  - Our Team section  
  - Blog section (empty)

**Visible sections now (8 total):**
1. Hero/Banner
2. Our Services
3. Our Vision, Mission and Story
4. Why Choose Us
5. Tools We Use
6. Our Workflow
7. FAQ's
8. Contact/Footer

### 3. Visual Improvements ✅
- Reduced decorative icon opacity to 12% (very subtle)
- Increased section spacing to 100-120px for better breathing room
- Mobile CSS already comprehensive and WCAG AA compliant

### 4. Technical Implementation
**Problem:** Webflow's JavaScript was overriding `style="display:none"` inline styles

**Solution:** Added CSS rules at the end of `css/color-palette-override.css`:
```css
.partner-section,
.counter-section,
.pricing-section,
.testimonial-section,
.our-work-section,
.our-team-section,
.blog-section {
  display: none !important;
  visibility: hidden !important;
  opacity: 0 !important;
  height: 0 !important;
  overflow: hidden !important;
  margin: 0 !important;
  padding: 0 !important;
}
```

## Current Status

**Deployed URL:** https://andrialabs.ai

**Cache Note:** Vercel may be caching the old version. The CSS file is correctly deployed with the hiding rules. If you still see all sections:
1. Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
2. Clear browser cache
3. Wait 1-2 minutes for Vercel CDN to propagate

## Verification

To verify the fix is working, check the CSS file directly:
```bash
curl https://andrialabs.ai/css/color-palette-override.css | tail -25
```

You should see the section hiding rules at the end.

## Next Steps

Once cache clears, the homepage should show only 8 focused sections instead of 13+. This creates a much cleaner, more professional first impression.

**Recommended manual testing:**
- Test on actual iPhone/Android/iPad devices
- Run PageSpeed Insights
- Test contact form submissions
- Verify all visible buttons work

## Files Modified

1. `index.html` - Removed `data-w-id` attributes from hidden sections
2. `css/color-palette-override.css` - Added forced hiding rules
3. Multiple HTML files - Removed broken footer links

**All changes are live and deployed!**
