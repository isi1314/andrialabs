        <h2 class="section-title">Why Work With Me</h2>
        <p class="value-prop-text">
          Whether I'm advising your team on architecture decisions or building your production system from scratch, you get the same level of rigor: PhD-level expertise, clear communication, and actionable solutions.
        </p>
        <p class="value-prop-text">
          No retainer treadmills. No maintenance lock-in. For consulting engagements, you get strategic guidance that empowers your team to execute confidently. For development projects, I build your system, transfer complete knowledge, and move on. You own everything-the code, the architecture, the understanding of how it all works.
        </p>
        <p class="value-prop-text">
          Most agencies keep you dependent by design. Junior devs learning on your time. Overcomplicated systems you can't maintain. Endless monthly contracts for basic updates. That's not how I work.
        </p>
        <p class="value-prop-text">
          You get direct access to research-grade expertise. Clear documentation. Knowledge transfer built into every engagement. When we're done, your team can run, extend, and improve everything without me.
