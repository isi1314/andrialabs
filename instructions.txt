# INSTANTLY.AI COLD EMAIL SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
# For: Andria Labs - Customer Acquisition via Cold Outreach
# Last Updated: October 30, 2025

================================================================================
CURRENT STATUS
================================================================================

‚úÖ COMPLETED:
- Instantly.ai account set up
- Email account added: isidora@andrialabs.ai
- MX records configured (mx1.instantly.ai, mx2.instantly.ai)
- SPF record added (includes Instantly + Resend)
- Warmup ENABLED and running

‚è≥ IN PROGRESS:
- Email warmup (2-3 weeks) - DO NOT send campaigns yet

üî≤ TODO:
- Add DMARC record
- Set up email forwarding for hello@andrialabs.ai
- Build lead list (50-100 prospects)
- Write first email campaign sequence
- Wait for warmup to complete
- Launch first campaign

================================================================================
SECTION 1: COMPLETE DNS SETUP (Do These Now)
================================================================================

1.1 ADD DMARC RECORD
--------------------
This improves email deliverability and protects your domain.

WHERE: Namecheap ‚Üí Domain List ‚Üí Manage andrialabs.ai ‚Üí Advanced DNS

ADD NEW RECORD:
Type: TXT Record
Host: _dmarc
Value: v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:hello@andrialabs.ai
TTL: Automatic

Click "Save All Changes"


1.2 SET UP EMAIL FORWARDING FOR hello@andrialabs.ai
----------------------------------------------------
Since you removed Resend's MX records, emails TO hello@andrialabs.ai
won't be received unless forwarded.

WHERE: Namecheap ‚Üí Advanced DNS ‚Üí Email Forwarding section

CLICK: Add Forwarder
Alias: hello
Forward To: [YOUR PERSONAL EMAIL ADDRESS - e.g., your Gmail]

This ensures contact form replies reach you.

NOTE: You can still SEND from hello@andrialabs.ai via Resend (contact form).
      You just can't RECEIVE at it without forwarding.


1.3 VERIFY DNS PROPAGATION
---------------------------
‚úÖ COMPLETED - DNS records verified and propagated successfully

MX Records (Verified October 30, 2025):
‚úÖ andrialabs.ai mail exchanger = 10 mx1.instantly.ai
‚úÖ andrialabs.ai mail exchanger = 20 mx2.instantly.ai

To verify again, run:
$ nslookup -type=MX andrialabs.ai

To check SPF and DMARC records, run:
$ nslookup -type=TXT andrialabs.ai

Expected TXT records:
- SPF: v=spf1 include:instantly.ai include:amazonses.com ~all
- DMARC: v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:hello@andrialabs.ai

================================================================================
SECTION 4: WRITE YOUR EMAIL SEQUENCE (Week 2)
================================================================================

Based on your playbook's "value-first" approach:

CAMPAIGN NAME: "AI Initiative Risk Assessment"
GOAL: Book 30-min free assessment calls
TARGET RESPONSE RATE: 5-15%

4.1 EMAIL 1 - VALUE HOOK (Day 0)
---------------------------------
SUBJECT LINE OPTIONS (A/B test):
A) Quick question about {{company}}'s AI roadmap
B) {{company}}'s AI initiative - 30-min diagnostic?
C) Risk assessment for {{company}}'s AI project

EMAIL BODY:
-----------
Hi {{firstName}},

I noticed {{company}} recently {{trigger}}.

Most AI initiatives at this stage hit one of three walls:
1. 6+ months in R&D with nothing shipped to production
2. $100k+ in compute costs that don't scale
3. No way to evaluate if it's actually working

I built a diagnostic framework that spots these issues in a 30-minute call,
and I'm offering 5 free assessments this month to {{title}}s at Series B companies.

Worth 15 minutes to see if you're on track?

Best,
Isidora Tourni
Founder, Andria Labs
[calendly link]

P.S. Here's a recent post on {{painPoint}}: {{blogLink}}


4.2 EMAIL 2 - PROOF (Day 4 if no response)
-------------------------------------------
SUBJECT: Re: Quick question about {{company}}'s AI roadmap

{{firstName}},

Following up on the free AI assessment I mentioned.

I should mention why I'm offering this:

I recently helped a Series B FinTech company fix their RAG system that was
costing $40k/month with 60% accuracy.

After our assessment ‚Üí implementation: 95% accuracy, $8k/month costs,
shipped in 10 weeks.

If you're investing in AI this quarter, 30 minutes could save you 6+ months
of wrong turns.

[calendly link]

Best,
Isidora


4.3 EMAIL 3 - BREAKUP (Day 8 if no response)
---------------------------------------------
SUBJECT: Closing the loop

{{firstName}},

I haven't heard back, so I'll assume this isn't a priority right now.

If anything changes or you hit a wall with your AI initiatives, my calendar
is here: [link]

In the meantime, here's a resource that might help: [link to best blog post]

Best of luck with {{trigger}},
Isidora

P.S. If you know another CTO/VP Eng dealing with AI challenges, feel free to
forward this.

SECTION 7: TRACK & OPTIMIZE
================================================================================

7.1 KEY METRICS TO MONITOR
---------------------------
METRIC                TARGET      RED FLAG
Open Rate             40-60%      <30% = deliverability issue
Reply Rate            5-15%       <2% = bad targeting/message
Positive Reply Rate   2-5%        <1% = wrong audience
Bounce Rate           <3%         >5% = bad list quality
Unsubscribe Rate      <1%         >2% = poor targeting

7.2 WHAT TO DO WITH REPLIES
----------------------------
POSITIVE REPLY ("Yes, let's talk"):
1. Move to HubSpot/CRM with source: "Cold Outbound"
2. Reply within 2 hours:

   "{{firstName}}, great to hear from you!

   Based on what you mentioned about {{their pain}}, I think a call would
   be valuable.

   Here's my calendar: [calendly link]

   Before we talk, it helps if you can share:
   1. What's the main AI challenge you're facing?
   2. What's at stake if it doesn't get solved?
   3. What's your timeline?

   Looking forward to it,
   Isidora"

3. Use Sales Call Script from /playbook/SALES_CALL_SCRIPT.md
4. Qualify hard (decision authority, budget, urgency)

NEUTRAL REPLY ("Tell me more" or "What do you offer?"):
1. Don't pitch yet, ask questions:

   "Happy to share more. Quick question first - what prompted you to reply?
   What AI challenge are you facing right now?"

2. Based on answer, determine if qualified
3. If qualified, book call
4. If not, send resource and nurture

NEGATIVE REPLY ("Not interested" or "Unsubscribe"):
1. Respect it immediately
2. Reply: "No problem, thanks for letting me know!"
3. Remove from campaign
4. Don't take it personally (98% won't reply anyway)

OBJECTION ("Too expensive" or "Not now"):
See playbook/SALES_CALL_SCRIPT.md Section: Common Objections

7.3 OPTIMIZATION CYCLE
----------------------
EVERY WEEK:
- Review metrics
- Identify best-performing subject lines
- Identify what triggers/pain points resonate
- Adjust messaging based on feedback

EVERY MONTH:
- Refresh lead list (add 50-100 new)
- Update case studies with recent wins
- Test new subject lines
- Adjust targeting if needed

================================================================================
SECTION 8: SCALING UP (Month 2-3)
================================================================================

WHEN TO SCALE:
‚úÖ First campaign running smoothly (Week 4+)
‚úÖ Reply rate 5%+
‚úÖ Booking 2-3 calls/week

HOW TO SCALE:

8.1 ADD MORE EMAIL ACCOUNTS
----------------------------
Set up 2-3 more sending accounts:
- consulting@team.andrialabs.ai
- partnerships@team.andrialabs.ai

Why: Spreads volume, reduces spam risk
Note: Each needs 2-3 week warmup

8.2 INCREASE DAILY VOLUME
--------------------------
Week 4: 30 emails/day
Week 6: 40 emails/day
Week 8: 50 emails/day
Month 3: 75-100 emails/day (across multiple accounts)

Never exceed 50 emails/day per account

8.3 RUN MULTIPLE CAMPAIGNS
---------------------------
Campaign 2: "AI Project Rescue"
Target: Companies with stalled AI projects
Hook: "6 months in, nothing shipped? Here's why"

Campaign 3: "Post-Funding AI Strategy"
Target: Just raised Series A/B (1-3 months ago)
Hook: "You raised $XM. Don't waste it on wrong AI approach"

Campaign 4: "AI Hiring & Interviewing"
Target: Companies posting AI job openings
Hook: "Hiring AI talent? Here's how to evaluate candidates"

8.4 BUILD NURTURE SEQUENCES
----------------------------
For leads who aren't ready yet:
