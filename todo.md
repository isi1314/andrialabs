1. No social proof - No testimonials, case studies, or client logos. Even
  just "Worked with X-stage startups" or industry mentions could help.
  2. No timeline/availability - Visitors don't know how long projects take or
  when you're available. Could add typical project durations or "Currently
  accepting projects for Q1 2025" type info.
  3. No pricing signals - Not even a rough range. Some visitors may self-filter
   before even reaching out. Could add "Projects starting at $X" or "Typical
  engagement: $XX-XXX".
  4. Security/Compliance - For enterprise clients, you might mention: SOC 2,
  GDPR compliance, security practices, NDA willingness.
  5. Industries/verticals - You mention general problems but not specific
  industries (fintech, healthcare, e-commerce, etc.). Could help certain
  visitors feel "this is for me".
  6. Team page - Footer links to team.html but it doesn't exist. Either remove
  the link or create a simple bio page.
  7. Past work/portfolio - No examples or project highlights (even anonymized).
   "Built X system that processes Y requests/day" type stuff.
  8. Geographic/timezone info - Remote work expectations, timezone, response
  times.
