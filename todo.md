## Remaining Items

1. **OG Image** - Create Open Graph image (1200x630px) at `/images/og-image.png` for social media sharing previews.

2. **Social proof** - No testimonials, case studies, or client logos. Even just "Worked with X-stage startups" or industry mentions could help.

3. **Timeline/availability** - Visitors don't know how long projects take or when you're available. Could add typical project durations or "Currently accepting projects for Q1 2026" type info.

4. **Industries/verticals** - You mention general problems but not specific industries (fintech, healthcare, e-commerce, etc.). Could help certain visitors feel "this is for me".

5. **Past work/portfolio** - No examples or project highlights (even anonymized). "Built X system that processes Y requests/day" type stuff.

6. **Google Search Console - Submit sitemap** - After deployment, go to Google Search Console and submit sitemap.xml (verification file is ready).

7. **Social profile setup** - Add website URL to LinkedIn company page and X profile for verification badges.

8. **Deploy to production** - Final deployment with all updates when Vercel daily limit resets.
